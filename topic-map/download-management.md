**Priority:** medium (high enthusiast demand)
**SEO notes:** Keyword cluster: "self-hosted download manager", "arr stack docker", "self-hosted torrent client", "best self-hosted download automation". High-intent enthusiast audience with strong overlap to media server users. The *arr stack (Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr) has extremely high search volume among homelab users. qBittorrent dominates torrent client queries. Usenet tools (SABnzbd, NZBGet) have a smaller but dedicated audience. Strategy: lead with qBittorrent and the *arr stack apps, then fill in supporting tools and stack guides.
