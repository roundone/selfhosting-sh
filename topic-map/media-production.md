# Media Production & Streaming [0/18 complete]
**Priority:** medium-high
**SEO notes:** Self-hosted livestreaming is a rapidly growing niche driven by creator dissatisfaction with Twitch monetization changes and YouTube's algorithmic control. Owncast is the breakout project — searches for "owncast" have grown steadily since 2022. PeerTube benefits from Fediverse/ActivityPub interest. "Self-hosted streaming" and "self-hosted alternative to Twitch" are medium-high volume with low competition — most results are Reddit threads and blog posts, not authoritative guides. Nginx RTMP module queries are high volume from developers building custom streaming pipelines. Video encoding (Handbrake, Tdarr) overlaps with media server optimization — cross-link heavily to media-servers and home-media categories. Ant Media Server targets the professional/commercial self-hosted streaming segment. Focus the pillar page on the roundup (/best/streaming-platforms) and build tight clusters from all app guides and comparisons back to it.
