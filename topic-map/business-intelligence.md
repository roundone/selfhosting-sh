# Business Intelligence & Dashboarding [0/13 complete]
**Priority:** medium-high
**SEO notes:** Keyword cluster: "self-hosted business intelligence", "self-hosted bi tools", "self-hosted alternative to tableau", "best self-hosted dashboard tool". Metabase dominates search interest in this category — it's the most accessible BI tool with strong Docker support and a large community. Apache Superset is the heavyweight open-source option backed by the Apache Foundation, popular with data engineering teams. Redash is well-known but development has slowed since Databricks acquired it — still widely deployed. Lightdash and Evidence represent the newer "analytics-as-code" / dbt-native wave. Cube.js is a headless BI / semantic layer tool targeting developers who want to build custom dashboards. The "replace Tableau" and "replace Power BI" angles have high commercial intent — organizations paying $70+/user/month for these tools are actively searching for alternatives. Strategy: lead with Metabase (highest search volume, broadest appeal), then Superset (enterprise credibility), then fill in Redash, Lightdash, Evidence. Cross-link heavily with the analytics and dashboards categories.
