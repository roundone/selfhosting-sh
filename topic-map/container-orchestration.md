# Container Orchestration [13/16 complete]
**Priority:** high
**SEO notes:** Kubernetes and container orchestration is a massive keyword space. k3s is the dominant lightweight Kubernetes distribution for self-hosting. Docker Swarm is simpler but less feature-rich. Nomad is HashiCorp's alternative. "k3s setup" and "kubernetes homelab" have very high search volume.
**Category keyword cluster:** "kubernetes self-hosted", "k3s setup", "docker swarm vs kubernetes", "best container orchestration homelab"
