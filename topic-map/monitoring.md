**Priority:** medium
**SEO notes:** Keyword cluster: "self-hosted monitoring", "self-hosted uptime monitoring", "grafana docker compose", "prometheus docker compose", "best self-hosted monitoring". Grafana and Prometheus together form the dominant monitoring stack in the self-hosting world with extremely high search volume. Uptime Kuma has surged in popularity as a lightweight uptime monitor. Netdata is a strong all-in-one alternative with growing interest. Replace guides for Datadog, UptimeRobot, Pingdom, and New Relic target high commercial intent (DevOps professionals evaluating self-hosted alternatives to expensive SaaS). Strategy: lead with Grafana and Prometheus (highest volume, cornerstone of the category), then Uptime Kuma (already done), then fill in Netdata, Zabbix, and niche tools.
