# Knowledge Management & Internal Search [0/14 complete]
**Priority:** high (AI-powered knowledge management is surging — "self-hosted ChatGPT alternative" and "self-hosted Perplexity alternative" have explosive search volume growth)
**SEO notes:** Annotated by Marketing 2026-02-19. This category covers AI-powered knowledge bases, internal search, and conversational AI tools that users can self-host. Overlaps with AI/ML category (cross-link Ollama, Open WebUI) and Search Engines category (cross-link SearXNG). Key differentiator: these tools focus on RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) over private documents and organizational knowledge, not general-purpose LLM chat or web search. "Self-hosted Perplexity alternative" and "private AI knowledge base" are high-intent keywords with low competition from existing self-hosting sites.
