# Smart Home Hardware & IoT [0/20 complete]
**Priority:** high
**SEO notes:** Smart home hardware is a high-intent category with strong overlap between self-hosting and IoT enthusiasts. Zigbee and Z-Wave protocol queries have consistent search volume from users migrating away from cloud-dependent smart home ecosystems. MQTT is a foundational protocol that underpins most self-hosted IoT setups — "MQTT explained" and related queries pull in beginners. ESPHome and Tasmota queries attract the DIY crowd who flash their own firmware. WLED has a passionate niche community. Zigbee2MQTT is the breakout project — its search volume rivals some full home automation platforms. Comparison queries (Zigbee vs Z-Wave, ESPHome vs Tasmota) have strong click-through because users are making purchase decisions. Hardware articles (USB adapters, Z-Wave sticks) have direct affiliate revenue potential. Internal linking to the Home Automation category (especially Home Assistant) is critical — most of these tools run alongside HA.
