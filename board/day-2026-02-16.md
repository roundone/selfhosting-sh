# Board Report — 2026-02-16

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 1 of operations. All 4 department head agents launched and producing output within minutes. Operations has written 10 articles (7 Foundations + 3 app guides) in the first hour. Technology is building the Astro site (pages, layouts, components done — deployment pending). Competitive analysis confirms the space is wide open — our largest competitor has only 622 articles. Three items require human action (see below).

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | 5,000+ | 0 live, 10 staged | Day 1 — production velocity is good |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 0 | Site not yet live |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | 0 | Site not yet live |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | Expected — no monetization yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 0 | Site not yet live |
| Social followers | 1,000+ | 0 | Blocked — social media API credentials missing |

## Decisions Requiring Approval
None.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

### 1. Sudo Access for VPS
**Urgency:** important (not blocking — workaround in place)
**Issue:** The `selfhosting` user on the VPS does not have passwordless sudo access. This means we cannot install systemd service files to `/etc/systemd/system/` for persistent agent process supervision.
**Workaround:** Using tmux sessions as interim process supervisor. Agents will run reliably but won't auto-restart on VPS reboot.
**Request:** Add the following to `/etc/sudoers.d/selfhosting`:
```
selfhosting ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/cp
```
Or simply: `selfhosting ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`
**Impact if deferred:** Agents won't survive VPS reboot. Manual restart required after any reboot.

### 2. Social Media API Credentials (NEW — from Marketing)
**Urgency:** blocking for social media operations
**Issue:** Social media accounts were created during pre-bootstrap (X, Mastodon, Bluesky, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode) but API tokens/credentials were NOT stored in `/opt/selfhosting-sh/credentials/api-keys.env`. Marketing cannot post or track any social metrics.
**Request:** Add API tokens for all social platforms to `credentials/api-keys.env`. Marketing provided the variable naming format. The specific tokens needed:
- **X/Twitter:** API Key, Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret
- **Mastodon:** Access Token (from mastodon.social Settings > Development)
- **Bluesky:** App Password (from bsky.social Settings > App Passwords)
- **Reddit:** Client ID, Client Secret, username, password
- **Dev.to:** API Key (from dev.to/settings/extensions)
- **Hashnode:** Personal Access Token + Publication ID
**Impact if deferred:** Social media launch completely blocked. Cannot build followers, post content, or track social metrics.

### 3. GA4 API Access (NEW — from BI)
**Urgency:** important
**Issue:** The Google Analytics Admin API and Data API are not enabled on GCP project `selfhosting-sh` (project 13850483084). The service account cannot enable them.
**Request:**
1. Enable Analytics Admin API: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analyticsadmin.googleapis.com/overview?project=13850483084
2. Enable Analytics Data API: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analyticsdata.googleapis.com/overview?project=13850483084
3. Provide the numeric GA4 property ID (found in GA4 Admin > Property Settings — not the measurement ID G-DPDC7W5VET).
**Impact if deferred:** BI cannot track traffic, sessions, or pageviews. GSC still works for search analytics.

### 4. Amazon Associates Signup
**When needed:** Month 1-2
**What's needed:** Sign up at affiliate-program.amazon.com using admin@selfhosting.sh. Requires tax information.
**Why:** Hardware affiliate links are our primary revenue source in Phase 1.

### 5. LinkedIn Developer App
**When needed:** This month
**What's needed:** Create a LinkedIn developer app linked to the selfhosting.sh company page (ID: 111603639). Then apply for Marketing Developer Platform access.
**Why:** Enables automated posting to LinkedIn company page.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$15/month (Hetzner CPX21)
- Domain: ~$0.83/month (amortized)
- Total monthly run rate: ~$15.83

## Key Risks
1. **No systemd = no auto-restart.** Mitigated by tmux for now, but a VPS reboot would require manual agent restart.
2. **Site build is the critical path.** Technology is progressing well but the site is not deployed yet. All SEO, traffic, and revenue metrics are blocked until deployment.
3. **Social media blocked.** Missing API credentials prevent Marketing from building social presence. Every day of delay reduces our early-mover advantage.
4. **Competitive window is open but closing.** noted.lol has 622 articles. No one has scaled. First-mover advantage in content volume is available now — but we need the site live to capture it.

## Key Wins (Day 1)
- All 4 agents launched and producing quality output within minutes
- Operations writing at good velocity (10 articles in first hour)
- Technology's Astro site structure nearly complete (pages, layouts, components all built)
- BI's competitive baseline reveals wide-open market opportunity
- Content quality verified — articles match our voice, have proper internal linking, pinned Docker versions

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Monitor 7 category writer output and content quality
- Launch Tier 2 writer when memory allows
- Verify Google starts crawling (sitemap was downloaded by Google today)
- Push Marketing on social media posting (Mastodon/Bluesky/Dev.to don't need extra credentials)
- Get social media credentials for blocked platforms (X, Reddit) resolved

## Addendum — 07:30 UTC Update

Since the initial board report was sent at ~07:04 UTC, significant progress has occurred:

### Updated Scorecard
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | 5,000+ | **34+** (22 prior + 12 new in last 10 min) | Still critical — but velocity increasing rapidly |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 0 | Sitemap submitted, Google downloading — expect indexing within 3-7 days |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | 0 | Waiting for indexing |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | Expected |
| Social followers | 1,000+ | 0 | Marketing directed to post on Mastodon/Bluesky/Dev.to now |

### Key Changes Since Initial Report
1. **Site is LIVE** — https://selfhosting.sh returns HTTP/2 200 with valid SSL. Auto-deploy runs every 5 min.
2. **DNS working** — Confirmed resolving via external DNS (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1).
3. **Sitemap submitted to GSC** — Google has downloaded it, 0 errors. Homepage status: "Discovered — currently not indexed."
4. **7 category writer sub-agents launched** — Foundations, Photo/Media, Password/AdBlock, VPN/FileSync, Proxy/Docker, HomeAuto/Notes, Hardware. Already producing output (12 new articles in ~10 minutes).
5. **Content types expanding** — First comparison articles (jellyfin-vs-plex, etc.), first replace guide (google-photos), and new foundations/app guides.
6. **Fixed git concurrency bug** — Multiple writers doing `git pull --rebase` simultaneously caused `fatal: Cannot rebase onto multiple branches`. Added flock-based serialization to `run-agent.sh`.
7. **Tier 2 writer prepared** — CLAUDE.md created but not launched (VPS memory at ~600MB available with 13 sessions).

### Updated Risk Assessment
1. ~~Site build is the critical path~~ → **RESOLVED.** Site is live and auto-deploying.
2. **VPS memory is the new constraint.** 3.8GB total, ~600MB free with 13 tmux sessions. Cannot add more writers without risk of OOM. May need VPS upgrade if we want more parallel writers.
3. **Social media still blocked for X/Reddit** — but Mastodon, Bluesky, Dev.to can proceed without extra credentials. Directed Marketing to start there.
4. **Content velocity improving but still far from target.** 34 articles vs 5,000 target. Need sustained 150-200 articles/day. Current burst rate with 7 writers suggests this is achievable if iterations continue reliably.
