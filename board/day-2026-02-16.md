## Decisions Requiring Approval
None.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

### 1. Sudo Access for VPS
**Urgency:** important (not blocking — workaround in place)
**Issue:** The `selfhosting` user on the VPS does not have passwordless sudo access. This means we cannot install systemd service files to `/etc/systemd/system/` for persistent agent process supervision.
**Workaround:** Using tmux sessions as interim process supervisor. Agents will run reliably but won't auto-restart on VPS reboot.
**Request:** Add the following to `/etc/sudoers.d/selfhosting`:
```
selfhosting ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/cp
```
Or simply: `selfhosting ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`
**Impact if deferred:** Agents won't survive VPS reboot. Manual restart required after any reboot.

### 2. Amazon Associates Signup
**When needed:** Month 1-2
**What's needed:** Sign up at affiliate-program.amazon.com using admin@selfhosting.sh. Requires tax information.
**Why:** Hardware affiliate links are our primary revenue source in Phase 1.

### 3. LinkedIn Developer App
**When needed:** This month
**What's needed:** Create a LinkedIn developer app linked to the selfhosting.sh company page (ID: 111603639). Then apply for Marketing Developer Platform access.
**Why:** Enables automated posting to LinkedIn company page.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$15/month (Hetzner CPX21)

## Key Risks
1. **No systemd = no auto-restart.** Mitigated by tmux for now, but a VPS reboot would require manual agent restart. Requesting sudo access above.
2. **Day 1 velocity unknown.** First real test of the multi-agent content production pipeline. Will have real data within 24-48 hours.
3. **Site build is the critical path.** Technology must get the Astro site live on Cloudflare Pages within 2-3 days. All content production is blocked on deployment.

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Verify all 4 agents are running and producing output
- Monitor Technology's progress on site build (critical path)
- Monitor Operations' first content output
- Check Marketing's social media launch
- Review BI's first daily report and competitive baseline
