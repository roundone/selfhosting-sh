# Board Report — 2026-02-20 (Updated 12:45 UTC)

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 5. **778 articles published.** Writers paused until Feb 22 per founder order — all 8 writer CLAUDE.md files updated and ready for resume. **GA4 data pipeline operational:** 51 users, 69 sessions, 11 organic Google sessions confirmed. Mastodon dramatically outperforms X (3.4 engagements/post vs 0). 2 page-1 keywords. Competitive position strong: 3.7x selfh.st, 2x noted.lol. Portal improvements in progress (IR spec delivered to Technology).

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | **1,500+** (revised) | 778 | **51.9%** — writers PAUSED until Feb 22. Need ~90/day for 8 days. |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 2 confirmed | On track — only 5 days since first impressions |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | **51 users / 69 sessions / 11 organic** (GA4 Feb 16-20) | Behind target but real traffic confirmed |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | On track — no revenue expected yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 3 (chatgpt.com, go.bsky.app, infosec.exchange) | Behind — but organic referrals starting |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | 1 | CRITICAL — engagement strategy overhaul underway |

## Founder Directive — Writer Pause (10:25 UTC)

**Directive received:** Pause ALL writers until Feb 22, 2026.

**Implementation:**
- All 8 writer wake-on.conf files set to `fallback: 48h`
- Hardware writer finished its current iteration naturally
- No writers currently running (confirmed)
- Coordinator config file is immutable (founder locked it) — 48h wake-on.conf is the effective control
- Notifications sent to Operations, Marketing, and BI about the pause and their focus areas

**Department focus during pause:**
- **Technology:** Portal, search, SEO, site quality improvements
- **Marketing:** Social media promotion, SEO analysis, content strategy for Feb 22 restart
- **BI & Finance:** GSC analysis, content performance audit, competitive analysis
- **Operations:** Content quality review, topic map optimization, writer restart planning
- **IR:** Portal spec iteration

## Earlier Actions (09:15 UTC)

### Founder Directives Processed
1. Month 1 Target → 1,500 ✓ DONE
2. Human Dependency Audit ✓ DONE (`board/human-dependency-audit-2026-02-20.md`)
3. Playwright-First Policy ✓ DONE (cascaded to all 5 dept CLAUDE.md files)
4. Investor Relations Department ✓ DONE (agents/investor-relations/ created)
5. Social Poster Fix ✓ DONE (X duplicate content loop fixed)
6. **Writer Pause ✓ DONE** (all 8 writers paused, notifications sent)

### Technology Deploy Pipeline Fix (10:07 UTC)
Technology reported and fixed a critical issue: `auto-deploy.sh` had crashed on Feb 16 (OOM at 1GB heap limit) and was never restarted. ~605 content files were not automatically deploying. Fix: rewrote deploy script (2GB heap, flock concurrency, change detection), created `selfhosting-deploy.timer` systemd timer (30-min interval). Tested successfully — 741 articles deployed, 21/21 QA checks passed.

## Decisions Requiring Approval
None.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

### 1. Social Media Credentials — 2 Platforms Still Blocked
**Status:** Partially resolved. 3/5 platforms now working (Mastodon, Dev.to, GA4).

| Platform | Status | Action Needed |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Mastodon** | **DONE** ✓ | Posting confirmed working |
| **Dev.to** | **DONE** ✓ | API key working |
| **GA4 API** | **DONE** ✓ | Data pipeline operational — 51 users confirmed |
| **Reddit** | BLOCKED | Reddit app creation shows policy wall. Not a credentials issue. Retry later. |
| **Hashnode** | PENDING | Still needs API token. Log into Hashnode > Settings > Developer > Generate PAT. |
| **LinkedIn** | DEPRIORITIZED | Per founder directive |

### 2. Amazon Associates Signup
**Status:** Not yet started. Requires tax info + identity verification. Should begin when we have meaningful traffic.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$15.83/month (Hetzner CPX21 upgraded to 8GB RAM + domain amortized)

## Key Risks

1. **Month 1 target requires sustained high velocity post-resume.** 778 articles vs 1,500 target (51.9%). Writers resume Feb 22 with 6 days remaining. Need ~722 articles in 6 days (~120/day). Achievable with all 8 writers running concurrently. Writer CLAUDE.md files are updated and ready.

2. **Social followers at 1 — engagement strategy overhaul underway.** Now posting on 3 platforms (X, Bluesky, Mastodon). Mastodon shows strong early signal (3.4 engagements/post). Marketing executing new engagement strategy (active follows, replies, non-link content). Dev.to cross-posting now possible.

3. **Zero clicks from Google despite 24 impressions.** Expected at day 5 of indexing. Position 3.0 for "freshrss vs miniflux" — clicks should follow. Feb 18-20 GSC data expected Feb 21-22.

4. **Sitemap gap closing.** 778 articles on disk, 516 in submitted sitemap. Deploy timer (30 min) regenerates sitemap automatically.

## Key Fixes Applied Today

### Deploy Pipeline Fix (Technology)
Auto-deploy loop crashed Feb 16 (OOM). Replaced with systemd timer — 30-min interval, 2GB heap, flock concurrency, post-deploy QA. Tested and working.

### Social Poster Fixes (CEO)
- Duplicate content fix: X posting stuck in infinite 403 loop. Fixed to skip rejected posts.
- Interval optimization: Reduced X interval to 15 min, Bluesky to 10 min.

## Update: Founder Directive Processed (11:00 UTC)

All 4 sections of the comprehensive founder directive have been processed:

### 1. Social Media Strategy Overhaul → DONE
- Marketing CLAUDE.md updated with full engagement strategy (active engagement, community participation, content variety, profile polish, daily targets)
- Directive sent to Marketing inbox with action items
- Key change: max 30% article links, 70%+ original/engagement content. Daily targets: 10+ follows, 5+ replies, 3+ posts, 2+ Reddit comments.
- Playwright MCP required for engagement activities (already installed)

### 2. Portal Improvements → IN PROGRESS
- IR directive sent: spec security (login page, HTTPS, session timeout), UI (fonts, polish), and alert logic
- Technology directive sent: create DNS record for portal.selfhosting.sh (Cloudflare proxy for HTTPS)
- Coordinator updated: `lastErrorAt` timestamp now tracked on agent errors (for smarter portal alerts)

### 3. Credentials → PROCESSED
- **Mastodon: CONFIRMED WORKING** — social poster already posting (verified 10:53 UTC)
- **Dev.to: API KEY LIVE** — cross-posting enabled for full articles with canonical_url
- **GA4 API: ENABLED** — BI notified to retry analytics queries
- Reddit: BLOCKED (policy wall on app creation page — not a credentials issue)
- LinkedIn: DEPRIORITIZED per founder

### 4. Writer Pause Reminder → ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
- Confirmed: all 8 writers on 48h fallback. maxWriters=0 config now active (reloaded at 10:56 UTC).
- Note: some writers started via writer-slot-available triggers before maxWriters=0 took effect. They will be paused on their next cycle.

### Operations Quality Audit Acknowledged
- 17 `:latest` Docker tags fixed (good)
- 612 short meta descriptions: **DEFERRED** — will bake 155-char minimum into writer CLAUDE.md files for new content, batch fix existing in Month 2
- Operations directed to focus remaining pause time on updating all 8 writer CLAUDE.md files for Feb 22 reassignment

## Escalations Requiring Human Action (Updated)

### Social Credentials — Updated Status
| Platform | Status | Action Needed |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Mastodon** | **DONE** ✓ | Working — posting confirmed |
| **Dev.to** | **DONE** ✓ | API key working |
| **GA4 API** | **DONE** ✓ | Enabled — BI testing |
| **Reddit** | BLOCKED | Reddit app creation shows policy wall. Retry later. |
| **Hashnode** | PENDING | Still needs API token |
| **LinkedIn** | DEPRIORITIZED | Per founder directive |

### Portal Security
Technology is implementing HTTPS via Cloudflare proxy on portal.selfhosting.sh. IR is speccing the full improvement. No human action needed for DNS — Technology has the Cloudflare API token.
