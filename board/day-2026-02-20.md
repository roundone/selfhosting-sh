# Board Report — 2026-02-20 (Updated 06:20 UTC)

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 5. 638 articles published. Content velocity recovered to ~21 articles/hour after coordinator v2.0 fixed the writer pipeline. Google indexing progressing — 9 pages with impressions, 2 page-1 keywords. Technology department discipline issues addressed per founder directive — CLAUDE.md updated with mandatory logging and inbox processing rules, inbox consolidated into single prioritized directive. All infrastructure services healthy. 5.8GB RAM available.

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | 5,000+ | 638 | Behind — 12.8%. Velocity recovering (~21/hr). Revised estimate: ~2,000 by Feb 28 |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 2 confirmed | On track — only 4 days since first impressions |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | ~0 clicks (24 impressions) | Early — GSC data lags 2-3 days |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | On track — no revenue expected yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 0 | Behind — cross-posting blocked pending credentials |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | 0 | Behind — posting live on X + Bluesky only |

## Actions Taken This Iteration (responding to founder directive)

### 1. Technology CLAUDE.md Updated
Added "MANDATORY DISCIPLINE" section to `agents/technology/CLAUDE.md` enforcing:
- Inbox processing at start of every iteration with logged confirmation
- Log entry at end of every iteration (no exceptions)
- Prohibition on modifying infrastructure scripts without CEO directive
- Priority-based inbox processing (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)

### 2. Technology Inbox Consolidated
Cleared 12 stale messages. Replaced with single prioritized directive:
- 4 items marked RESOLVED (search, Playwright MCP, dashboard, QA) — Technology should confirm in its log
- 1 HIGH item: Investigate GSC sitemap warnings
- 1 MEDIUM item: Verify auto-deploy of 40 new AI/ML + Search Engines articles

### 3. Technology Status — Actually Better Than Feared
Technology's `strategy.md` (updated Feb 20) reveals it DID complete:
- Playwright MCP installed (`@playwright/mcp@0.0.68` with Chromium)
- Status dashboard live at `:8080` as systemd service
- Post-deploy QA script (`bin/post-deploy-qa.sh`) integrated into auto-deploy
- GSC sitemap investigated (API shows 0 warnings; resubmitted with 649 URLs)

The problem was not inaction — it was **failure to log and communicate**. The CLAUDE.md update addresses this directly.

### 4. Writer Pipeline Status
- `proxy-docker-writer`: Completed AI/ML + Search Engines (40 articles). Already reassigned to Newsletters & File Sharing.
- `vpn-filesync-writer`: Running (first iteration)
- `tier2-writer`: Last ran 05:45 UTC, producing content
- 5 more writers queued, rotating in as slots open (max 4 concurrent)

## Decisions Requiring Approval
**Revised Month 1 target:** The 5,000 article target is mathematically unreachable (638 + ~200/day x 8 days = ~2,238 max). Recommend accepting ~2,000 as Month 1 actual and reaffirming 5,000 as a Month 2 milestone. The infrastructure now supports sustained parallel production. **Request: Board acknowledgment of revised trajectory.**

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

### 1. Social Media Credentials — 5 Platforms Still Blocked
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16, re-escalated Feb 20)

| Platform | What's Needed | Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Mastodon** | Log into mastodon.social as @selfhostingsh, Preferences > Development > New Application > generate access token with `read write` scopes. Update MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN in api-keys.env | FOSS community reach blocked |
| **Dev.to** | Log into dev.to > Settings > Extensions > Generate API Key. Update DEVTO_API_KEY in api-keys.env | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **Reddit** | Create OAuth app at reddit.com/prefs/apps/ (script type) for u/selfhostingsh. Update REDDIT_CLIENT_ID and REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET | Community engagement blocked |
| **Hashnode** | Log into Hashnode > Settings > Developer > Generate PAT. Update HASHNODE_API_TOKEN | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **LinkedIn** | Create LinkedIn Developer App linked to company page (ID: 111603639). Apply for Marketing Developer Platform access | Professional audience blocked |

**Priority:** Mastodon > Dev.to > Reddit > Hashnode > LinkedIn

### 2. GA4 API Access
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16)
Enable GA4 Data API and Admin API on GCP project `selfhosting-sh`. Need numeric GA4 property ID (not measurement ID G-DPDC7W5VET). Without this, BI cannot track traffic.

### 3. Amazon Associates Signup
**Status:** Not yet started. Requires tax info + identity verification. Should begin when we have meaningful traffic.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$15.83/month (Hetzner CPX21 upgraded to 8GB RAM + domain amortized)

## Key Risks

1. **Content velocity gap.** 638 articles vs 5,000 target. Velocity recovering but target unreachable in 8 days. Writers are producing — just need time.

2. **Social platform reach limited.** Only X and Bluesky active. 5 platforms blocked pending credentials. Zero followers anywhere. Queue has 1,814 posts but only 2 platforms can consume them.

3. **Zero clicks from Google.** 24 impressions, 0 clicks. Expected at this stage (day 4-5 of indexing) but CTR will need attention once impressions grow. May need title/description optimization.

4. **Technology communication gap resolved.** CLAUDE.md updated with mandatory discipline rules. Will monitor next iteration for compliance.

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. **Monitor Technology compliance** — Next iteration should have a log entry and inbox acknowledgment
2. **Track content velocity** — Target 200+ articles/day with writer pipeline at full capacity
3. **Monitor GSC indexing** — Expect new impression data by Feb 21-22 for articles submitted Feb 19-20
4. **Push for social credentials** — Re-escalate if no response by tomorrow
5. **Verify writer rotation** — As writers complete categories, ensure smooth reassignment
