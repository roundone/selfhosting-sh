# Board Report — 2026-02-20 (Updated 10:25 UTC)

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 5. **759 articles published.** Writer pause directive received and implemented — all writers paused until Feb 22 per founder order. Focus shifts to Technology, Marketing, BI, IR. Deploy pipeline fixed by Technology (was broken since Feb 16). 2 page-1 keywords. Social posting working on X + Bluesky. Competitive position strong: 3.6x selfh.st, ~2x noted.lol.

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | **1,500+** (revised) | 759 | **50.6%** — writers PAUSED until Feb 22 per founder directive |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 2 confirmed | On track — only 5 days since first impressions |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | ~0 clicks (24 impressions) | Early — GSC data lags 2-3 days |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | On track — no revenue expected yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 0 | Behind — cross-posting blocked pending credentials |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | 1 | Behind — posting live on X + Bluesky only |

## Founder Directive — Writer Pause (10:25 UTC)

**Directive received:** Pause ALL writers until Feb 22, 2026.

**Implementation:**
- All 8 writer wake-on.conf files set to `fallback: 48h`
- Hardware writer finished its current iteration naturally
- No writers currently running (confirmed)
- Coordinator config file is immutable (founder locked it) — 48h wake-on.conf is the effective control
- Notifications sent to Operations, Marketing, and BI about the pause and their focus areas

**Department focus during pause:**
- **Technology:** Portal, search, SEO, site quality improvements
- **Marketing:** Social media promotion, SEO analysis, content strategy for Feb 22 restart
- **BI & Finance:** GSC analysis, content performance audit, competitive analysis
- **Operations:** Content quality review, topic map optimization, writer restart planning
- **IR:** Portal spec iteration

### Technology Deploy Pipeline Fix (10:07 UTC)
Technology reported and fixed a critical issue: `auto-deploy.sh` had crashed on Feb 16 (OOM at 1GB heap limit) and was never restarted. ~605 content files were not automatically deploying. Fix: rewrote deploy script (2GB heap, flock concurrency, change detection), created `selfhosting-deploy.timer` systemd timer (30-min interval). Tested successfully — 741 articles deployed, 21/21 QA checks passed.

## Decisions Requiring Approval
None.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

### 1. Social Media Credentials — 5 Platforms Still Blocked
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16, re-escalated Feb 20)

| Platform | What's Needed | Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Mastodon** | Log into mastodon.social as @selfhostingsh, Preferences > Development > New Application > generate access token with `read write` scopes. Update MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN in api-keys.env | FOSS community reach blocked |
| **Dev.to** | Log into dev.to > Settings > Extensions > Generate API Key. Update DEVTO_API_KEY in api-keys.env | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **Reddit** | Create OAuth app at reddit.com/prefs/apps/ (script type) for u/selfhostingsh. Update REDDIT_CLIENT_ID and REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET | Community engagement blocked |
| **Hashnode** | Log into Hashnode > Settings > Developer > Generate PAT. Update HASHNODE_API_TOKEN | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **LinkedIn** | Create LinkedIn Developer App linked to company page (ID: 111603639). Apply for Marketing Developer Platform access | Professional audience blocked |

**Priority:** Mastodon > Dev.to > Reddit > Hashnode > LinkedIn

### 2. GA4 API Access
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16)
Enable GA4 Data API and Admin API on GCP project `selfhosting-sh`. Need numeric GA4 property ID (not measurement ID G-DPDC7W5VET). Without this, BI cannot track traffic.

### 3. Amazon Associates Signup
**Status:** Not yet started. Requires tax info + identity verification. Should begin when we have meaningful traffic.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$15.83/month (Hetzner CPX21 upgraded to 8GB RAM + domain amortized)

## Key Risks

1. **Month 1 target impact from writer pause.** 759 articles vs 1,500 target (50.6%). Writers paused until Feb 22 (2 days). With 6 days remaining after resume (Feb 22-28), need ~741 articles in 6 days (~124/day). This is achievable with multiple concurrent writers but tight. Founder is aware of this tradeoff.

2. **Social platform reach limited.** Only X and Bluesky active. 5 platforms blocked pending credentials. 1 follower. Queue has 1,916 posts.

3. **Zero clicks from Google.** 24 impressions, 0 clicks. Expected at this stage (day 4-5 of indexing). Feb 18-20 data should appear in GSC by Feb 21-22.

4. **Sitemap gap closing.** 759 articles on disk but only 516 in sitemap. Deploy timer (every 30 min) will resolve this automatically.

## Key Fixes Applied Today

### Deploy Pipeline Fix (Technology)
Auto-deploy loop crashed Feb 16 (OOM). Replaced with systemd timer — 30-min interval, 2GB heap, flock concurrency, post-deploy QA. Tested and working.

### Social Poster Fixes (CEO)
- Duplicate content fix: X posting stuck in infinite 403 loop. Fixed to skip rejected posts.
- Interval optimization: Reduced X interval to 15 min, Bluesky to 10 min.

## Update: Founder Directive Processed (11:00 UTC)

All 4 sections of the comprehensive founder directive have been processed:

### 1. Social Media Strategy Overhaul → DONE
- Marketing CLAUDE.md updated with full engagement strategy (active engagement, community participation, content variety, profile polish, daily targets)
- Directive sent to Marketing inbox with action items
- Key change: max 30% article links, 70%+ original/engagement content. Daily targets: 10+ follows, 5+ replies, 3+ posts, 2+ Reddit comments.
- Playwright MCP required for engagement activities (already installed)

### 2. Portal Improvements → IN PROGRESS
- IR directive sent: spec security (login page, HTTPS, session timeout), UI (fonts, polish), and alert logic
- Technology directive sent: create DNS record for portal.selfhosting.sh (Cloudflare proxy for HTTPS)
- Coordinator updated: `lastErrorAt` timestamp now tracked on agent errors (for smarter portal alerts)

### 3. Credentials → PROCESSED
- **Mastodon: CONFIRMED WORKING** — social poster already posting (verified 10:53 UTC)
- **Dev.to: API KEY LIVE** — cross-posting enabled for full articles with canonical_url
- **GA4 API: ENABLED** — BI notified to retry analytics queries
- Reddit: BLOCKED (policy wall on app creation page — not a credentials issue)
- LinkedIn: DEPRIORITIZED per founder

### 4. Writer Pause Reminder → ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
- Confirmed: all 8 writers on 48h fallback. maxWriters=0 config now active (reloaded at 10:56 UTC).
- Note: some writers started via writer-slot-available triggers before maxWriters=0 took effect. They will be paused on their next cycle.

### Operations Quality Audit Acknowledged
- 17 `:latest` Docker tags fixed (good)
- 612 short meta descriptions: **DEFERRED** — will bake 155-char minimum into writer CLAUDE.md files for new content, batch fix existing in Month 2
- Operations directed to focus remaining pause time on updating all 8 writer CLAUDE.md files for Feb 22 reassignment

## Escalations Requiring Human Action (Updated)

### Social Credentials — Updated Status
| Platform | Status | Action Needed |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Mastodon** | **DONE** ✓ | Working — posting confirmed |
| **Dev.to** | **DONE** ✓ | API key working |
| **GA4 API** | **DONE** ✓ | Enabled — BI testing |
| **Reddit** | BLOCKED | Reddit app creation shows policy wall. Retry later. |
| **Hashnode** | PENDING | Still needs API token |
| **LinkedIn** | DEPRIORITIZED | Per founder directive |

### Portal Security
Technology is implementing HTTPS via Cloudflare proxy on portal.selfhosting.sh. IR is speccing the full improvement. No human action needed for DNS — Technology has the Cloudflare API token.

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. **Marketing: execute social engagement strategy** — Active engagement via Playwright, diverse content, profile optimization
2. **Technology: portal.selfhosting.sh DNS + portal improvements** — Implement IR's spec
3. **BI: GA4 API queries + daily report** — Test GA4 analytics now that API is enabled
4. **Operations: writer CLAUDE.md updates for Feb 22** — All 8 writers need updated instructions before resume
5. **Monitor GSC indexing** — Feb 18-20 data expected Feb 21-22
6. **Dev.to cross-posting** — Marketing should start cross-posting top articles
