# Board Report — 2026-02-20

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 5. 563 articles published, significantly ahead of both competitors (selfh.st: 209, noted.lol: 386). Google has begun indexing — 9 pages showing search impressions, best position 4.5. Social posting to X and Bluesky is now live via queue system. Content velocity is the primary risk: 563/5,000 target (11.3%) with 8 days remaining. Infrastructure is stable.

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | 5,000+ | 563 | Behind — 11.3% of target |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | ~3-5 (early data) | On track — only 4 days since first impressions |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | ~20-50 (estimated from impressions) | On track for week 1 |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | On track — no revenue expected yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 0 | Behind — cross-posting blocked |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | ~0 | Behind — just started posting |

## What Happened Since Last Report (Feb 16)

### Content (563 articles, +189 since last report)
- All CRITICAL/HIGH stale content fixed: Ghost v6, Stirling-PDF v2.5, Mealie v3, Homarr v1.53, Radarr v6, PrivateBin v2, NetBird v0.65.3
- 7 /best/ pillar pages completed (password-management, ad-blocking, vpn, photo-management, media-servers, file-sync, note-taking)
- Affiliate disclosures removed per founder directive — zero found in content, AffiliateDisclosure component deleted from templates
- Velocity slowed after Day 1 burst (374 articles in 12h). Days 2-5 added ~189 articles, focused on quality: freshness fixes, pillar pages, version verification

### SEO (Google is crawling)
- GSC now has 516 URLs submitted (was 34 at last report)
- **9 pages showing search impressions** as of Feb 19:
  - `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 8 impressions, avg position 6.9
  - `/compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/` — 4 impressions, avg position 4.5
  - `/foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/` — 4 impressions, avg position 7.2
- 3 sitemap warnings in GSC — Technology investigating
- This is ahead of expectations for day 4 of indexing

### Social Media (queue system live)
- Social posting architecture built and deployed per founder directive
- `bin/social-poster.js` running every 5 min via coordinator
- X (Twitter): LIVE — first post at 23:55 UTC Feb 19
- Bluesky: LIVE — first post at 23:55 UTC Feb 19
- 56 posts queued and processing
- Marketing HOLD lifted — Marketing can now queue freely

### Infrastructure
- Coordinator v1.1 running (8h-fallback, usage-limit-detection)
- Rate-limiting proxy: healthy, 11% usage
- VPS: 2.6GB available RAM, load 0.02
- All agents iterating via coordinator (not systemd services directly)

## Decisions Requiring Approval
None.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

### 1. Social Media Credentials — 5 Platforms Still Blocked
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16)

X and Bluesky are now live. The following still need real credentials:

| Platform | What's Needed | Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Mastodon** | Log into mastodon.social as @selfhostingsh → Preferences → Development → New Application → generate access token with `read write` scopes. Update MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN in api-keys.env | FOSS community reach blocked |
| **Dev.to** | Log into dev.to → Settings → Extensions → Generate API Key. Update DEVTO_API_KEY in api-keys.env | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **Reddit** | Create OAuth app at reddit.com/prefs/apps/ (script type) for u/selfhostingsh. Update REDDIT_CLIENT_ID and REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET | Community engagement blocked |
| **Hashnode** | Log into Hashnode → Settings → Developer → Generate PAT. Update HASHNODE_API_TOKEN | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **LinkedIn** | Create LinkedIn Developer App linked to company page (ID: 111603639). Apply for Marketing Developer Platform access. | Professional audience blocked |

**Priority:** Mastodon (FOSS community, free API) > Dev.to (backlinks) > Reddit (engagement) > Hashnode (backlinks) > LinkedIn (pending API approval anyway)

### 2. GA4 API Access
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16)

GA4 Data API and Admin API need to be enabled on GCP project `selfhosting-sh` by a project owner/editor. Without this, BI cannot track traffic. Also need the numeric GA4 property ID (not the measurement ID G-DPDC7W5VET).

### 3. Amazon Associates Signup
**Status:** Not yet started. Requires tax info + identity verification. Should begin when we have meaningful traffic.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$9.50/month (Hetzner CPX21)

## Key Risks

1. **Content velocity.** 563 articles in 5 days. Need 5,000 by Feb 28. Current pace will miss by ~4,000. The 5,000 target was premised on sustained 400+ articles/day; actual sustained rate after Day 1 is ~50/day. **Recommendation:** Either accept a revised Month 1 target (~1,000-1,500 articles) or dramatically increase parallel writer capacity. This is the biggest strategic question facing the business.

2. **Cross-posting delayed.** Dev.to and Hashnode credentials still pending. Every day without cross-posting is a day without backlinks from these platforms. Referring domains target (10+) depends on this.

3. **Social follower count at ~0.** Just started posting (Feb 19 23:55 UTC). Need sustained high-quality posting across platforms + engagement to build following. Month 1 target of 1,000+ will be difficult from a standing start with 8 days remaining.

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. **Content velocity** — Assess whether writers are producing or blocked. If topic map exhaustion, direct Marketing to expand. If rate limiting, explore optimization.
2. **Social queue** — Verify X and Bluesky posts are going out. Direct Marketing to flood queue.
3. **Technology status** — Get updates on search fix, Playwright MCP, and status dashboard.
4. **Monitor GSC** — Track indexing progress and investigate 3 sitemap warnings.
