# Board Report — 2026-02-20

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 5. 555 articles published (135 apps, 186 compare, 93 foundations, 69 hardware, 43 replace, 19 best, 10 troubleshooting). Google is indexing — 9 pages showing search impressions, best position 4.5. Social posting live on X and Bluesky (1,663 posts queued). **CRITICAL: Root cause of velocity collapse found and fixed — the coordinator migration on Feb 18 broke the writer sub-agent pipeline. All 8 writers have been dead for 4 days. Coordinator v1.2 deployed with writer discovery. Also: Technology department has produced zero logged work since Feb 16.** Restarting coordinator to activate fix.

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | 5,000+ | 555 | Behind — 11.1% (writer pipeline was broken, now fixed) |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | ~3-5 (early data) | On track — only 4 days since first impressions |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | ~20-50 (estimated from impressions) | On track for week 1 |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | On track — no revenue expected yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 0 | Behind — cross-posting blocked |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | ~0 | Behind — just started posting |

## What Happened Since Last Report (Feb 16)

### Content (563 articles, +189 since last report)
- All CRITICAL/HIGH stale content fixed: Ghost v6, Stirling-PDF v2.5, Mealie v3, Homarr v1.53, Radarr v6, PrivateBin v2, NetBird v0.65.3
- 7 /best/ pillar pages completed (password-management, ad-blocking, vpn, photo-management, media-servers, file-sync, note-taking)
- Affiliate disclosures removed per founder directive — zero found in content, AffiliateDisclosure component deleted from templates
- Velocity slowed after Day 1 burst (374 articles in 12h). Days 2-5 added ~189 articles, focused on quality: freshness fixes, pillar pages, version verification

### SEO (Google is crawling)
- GSC now has 516 URLs submitted (was 34 at last report)
- **9 pages showing search impressions** as of Feb 19:
  - `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 8 impressions, avg position 6.9
  - `/compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/` — 4 impressions, avg position 4.5
  - `/foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/` — 4 impressions, avg position 7.2
- 3 sitemap warnings in GSC — Technology investigating
- This is ahead of expectations for day 4 of indexing

### Social Media (queue system live)
- Social posting architecture built and deployed per founder directive
- `bin/social-poster.js` running every 5 min via coordinator
- X (Twitter): LIVE — first post at 23:55 UTC Feb 19
- Bluesky: LIVE — first post at 23:55 UTC Feb 19
- 1,663 posts now queued (Marketing flooded the queue as directed)
- Marketing HOLD lifted — Marketing queuing aggressively

### Infrastructure — CRITICAL FIX
- **Root cause of velocity collapse identified:** When the coordinator replaced the old supervisor on Feb 18, it only discovers 5 top-level agents (ceo, technology, marketing, operations, bi-finance). The 8 writer sub-agents under `agents/operations/writers/` were NOT discovered and have been dead for 4 days. This is why velocity dropped from 374 articles/day to ~47 articles/day.
- **Fix deployed:** Coordinator v1.2 with three changes:
  1. `discoverAgents()` now recursively finds writer sub-agents at `agents/*/writers/*/CLAUDE.md`
  2. Per-agent fallback intervals via `wake-on.conf` (writers set to 30m instead of 8h)
  3. Writer concurrency limit (max 3 simultaneous writers to prevent OOM on 4GB VPS)
- **Technology department non-functional:** Zero logged work since Feb 16. No progress on search fix, Playwright MCP, or status dashboard. Operations crashing 19/20 runs.
- Rate-limiting proxy: healthy, 58% usage (elevated from 11% due to concurrent agents)
- VPS: 2.2GB available RAM, load 0.28
- Social poster: running every 5 min, 1,663 posts in queue (Marketing flooded it)

## Decisions Requiring Approval
None.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

### 1. Social Media Credentials — 5 Platforms Still Blocked
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16)

X and Bluesky are now live. The following still need real credentials:

| Platform | What's Needed | Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Mastodon** | Log into mastodon.social as @selfhostingsh → Preferences → Development → New Application → generate access token with `read write` scopes. Update MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN in api-keys.env | FOSS community reach blocked |
| **Dev.to** | Log into dev.to → Settings → Extensions → Generate API Key. Update DEVTO_API_KEY in api-keys.env | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **Reddit** | Create OAuth app at reddit.com/prefs/apps/ (script type) for u/selfhostingsh. Update REDDIT_CLIENT_ID and REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET | Community engagement blocked |
| **Hashnode** | Log into Hashnode → Settings → Developer → Generate PAT. Update HASHNODE_API_TOKEN | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **LinkedIn** | Create LinkedIn Developer App linked to company page (ID: 111603639). Apply for Marketing Developer Platform access. | Professional audience blocked |

**Priority:** Mastodon (FOSS community, free API) > Dev.to (backlinks) > Reddit (engagement) > Hashnode (backlinks) > LinkedIn (pending API approval anyway)

### 2. GA4 API Access
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16)

GA4 Data API and Admin API need to be enabled on GCP project `selfhosting-sh` by a project owner/editor. Without this, BI cannot track traffic. Also need the numeric GA4 property ID (not the measurement ID G-DPDC7W5VET).

### 3. Amazon Associates Signup
**Status:** Not yet started. Requires tax info + identity verification. Should begin when we have meaningful traffic.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$9.50/month (Hetzner CPX21)

## Key Risks

1. **Content velocity — root cause FOUND and FIXED.** The coordinator migration on Feb 18 broke the writer pipeline. All 8 writers have been dead for 4 days. Coordinator v1.2 fixes this with recursive agent discovery. Once restarted, up to 3 writers will run concurrently on 30-minute cycles. Expected velocity recovery: 100-200 articles/day. The 5,000 Month 1 target is now mathematically unreachable (555 articles + ~200/day × 8 days = ~2,155 max). **Recommendation:** Accept a revised Month 1 target of ~2,000 articles and reaffirm the 5,000 target as a Month 2 milestone. The infrastructure now supports sustained parallel production.

2. **Technology department non-functional.** Zero logged activity since Feb 16. Three critical/high founder directives unstarted (search fix, Playwright MCP, status dashboard). Technology's agent has `consecutiveErrors: 1` from the SIGTERM during coordinator restart but appears to be running now (started at 00:58 UTC). Need to monitor whether this iteration produces results.

3. **Cross-posting delayed.** Dev.to and Hashnode credentials still pending. Referring domains target depends on this.

4. **Social follower count at ~0.** Just started posting Feb 19. Queue is now healthy (1,663 posts). Rate limits constrain output to ~24 X posts/day and ~48 Bluesky posts/day.

## Founder Directives — Completion Status
| # | Directive | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Fix broken search | **NOT STARTED** — Technology has no logged activity since Feb 16 |
| 2 | GA4 in board reports | Blocked by API access (Requires: human) |
| 3 | Rate-limiting proxy awareness | COMPLETE |
| 4 | systemd migration | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Install Playwright MCP | **NOT STARTED** — Playwright binary exists but no MCP integration |
| 6 | Build status dashboard | **NOT STARTED** — no dashboard files exist |
| 7 | Monitor API usage at 85% | COMPLETE |
| 8 | Remove affiliate disclosures | COMPLETE |
| 9 | Social posting architecture | COMPLETE |
| 10 | Remove Marketing HOLD | COMPLETE |

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. **Verify writer pipeline restored** — After coordinator restart, confirm writers are running and producing articles
2. **Technology accountability** — If Technology still shows no progress after its current iteration, consider updating its CLAUDE.md or spawning a specialist to handle the search fix directly
3. **Monitor social queue processing** — X and Bluesky should be posting regularly
4. **Track GSC indexing progress** — 9 pages with impressions, monitoring for growth
5. **Prepare revised Month 1 target proposal** — 2,000 articles is realistic; 5,000 is not
