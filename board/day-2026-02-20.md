# Board Report — 2026-02-20 (Updated 20:20 UTC)

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 5. **GSC BREAKTHROUGH: 16 page-1 keyword+page combos, 518 impressions (20x increase in one day).** 780 articles published. Writers paused until Feb 22. All founder directives COMPLETE. GA4 confirms 72 users/97 sessions (Feb 16-20), Feb 20 is best day. Social: 39 followers (Mastodon 33). Trailing slash SEO fix sent to Technology. Comparison-first strategy validated.

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | **1,500+** (revised) | 780 | **52.0%** — writers PAUSED until Feb 22. Need ~90/day for 8 days. |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | **16** (query+page combos) | **8x growth** — exponential trajectory |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | **72 users / 97 sessions / 15 organic** (GA4 Feb 16-20) | Behind target but accelerating — Feb 20 best day (28 users) |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | On track — no revenue expected yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 4 (chatgpt.com, go.bsky.app, infosec.exchange, mstdn.social) | Behind — but organic referrals growing |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | **39** (Mastodon: 33, Bluesky: 6) | Behind target — but Mastodon growth sustaining (was 8 earlier today) |

## Founder Directive — Writer Pause (10:25 UTC)

**Directive received:** Pause ALL writers until Feb 22, 2026.

**Implementation:**
- All 8 writer wake-on.conf files set to `fallback: 48h`
- Hardware writer finished its current iteration naturally
- No writers currently running (confirmed)
- Coordinator config file is immutable (founder locked it) — 48h wake-on.conf is the effective control
- Notifications sent to Operations, Marketing, and BI about the pause and their focus areas

**Department focus during pause:**
- **Technology:** Portal, search, SEO, site quality improvements
- **Marketing:** Social media promotion, SEO analysis, content strategy for Feb 22 restart
- **BI & Finance:** GSC analysis, content performance audit, competitive analysis
- **Operations:** Content quality review, topic map optimization, writer restart planning
- **IR:** Portal spec iteration

## Earlier Actions (09:15 UTC)

### Founder Directives Processed
1. Month 1 Target → 1,500 ✓ DONE
2. Human Dependency Audit ✓ DONE (`board/human-dependency-audit-2026-02-20.md`)

### Technology Deploy Pipeline Fix (10:07 UTC)
Technology reported and fixed a critical issue: `auto-deploy.sh` had crashed on Feb 16 (OOM at 1GB heap limit) and was never restarted. ~605 content files were not automatically deploying. Fix: rewrote deploy script (2GB heap, flock concurrency, change detection), created `selfhosting-deploy.timer` systemd timer (30-min interval). Tested successfully — 741 articles deployed, 21/21 QA checks passed.

## Decisions Requiring Approval
None.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

### 1. Social Media Credentials — 2 Platforms Still Blocked
**Status:** Partially resolved. 3/5 platforms now working (Mastodon, Dev.to, GA4).

| Platform | Status | Action Needed |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Mastodon** | **DONE** ✓ | Posting confirmed working |
| **Dev.to** | **DONE** ✓ | API key working |
| **GA4 API** | **DONE** ✓ | Data pipeline operational — 51 users confirmed |
| **Reddit** | BLOCKED | Reddit app creation shows policy wall. Not a credentials issue. Retry later. |
| **Hashnode** | **DONE** ✓ | Cross-posting active — 11 articles published |
| **LinkedIn** | DEPRIORITIZED | Per founder directive |

### 2. Amazon Associates Signup
**Status:** Not yet started. Requires tax info + identity verification. Should begin when we have meaningful traffic.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$15.83/month (Hetzner CPX21 upgraded to 8GB RAM + domain amortized)

## GSC Breakthrough (16:00 UTC Update)

**Google Search Console data from Feb 18 shows a massive inflection point:**

| Date | Impressions | Clicks | Avg Position |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Feb 17 | 24 | 0 | 6.3 |
| Feb 18 | **494** | 0 | 6.6 |
| **Total (7-day)** | **518** | **0** | — |

**15 page-1 keywords confirmed** (positions ≤ 10):
- Top performers: calibre vs kavita (pos 3), miniflux vs freshrss (pos 3), freshrss vs miniflux (pos 3.8)
- 10 of 15 are comparison/niche queries — validates comparison-first content strategy
- Top page by impressions: `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` with 181 impressions
- 22 pages now showing impressions (was 9)

**Implication for Feb 22 writer restart:** Double down on niche comparison content. This is our fastest path to rankings and clicks.

## Key Risks

1. **Month 1 target requires sustained high velocity post-resume.** 780 articles vs 1,500 target (52.0%). Writers resume Feb 22 with 6 days remaining. Need ~720 articles in 6 days (~120/day). Achievable with all 8 writers running concurrently. Writer CLAUDE.md files are updated and ready.

2. **Social followers at 39 and growing.** Mastodon: 33 followers (0.43 followers/post — strong). Bluesky: 6. Dev.to: 30 cross-posted articles. Hashnode: 11 cross-posted. Still far from 1,000+ target but Mastodon trajectory is encouraging.

3. **Zero clicks in GSC despite 518 impressions.** However, GA4 confirms 15 Google organic sessions — clicks ARE happening but GSC lags 2-3 days. Feb 19-20 GSC data (available Feb 21-22) should confirm click-throughs.

4. **Sitemap gap RESOLVED.** 789 URLs submitted, 780 articles on disk. Google re-downloaded sitemap at 18:24 UTC Feb 20. All articles discoverable.

5. **Trailing slash SEO issue (NEW).** GSC shows 2 pages split across canonical/non-canonical URLs (e.g., `/apps/domoticz` vs `/apps/domoticz/`), diluting impressions. Sent to Technology for quick fix.

## Key Fixes Applied Today

### Deploy Pipeline Fix (Technology)
Auto-deploy loop crashed Feb 16 (OOM). Replaced with systemd timer — 30-min interval, 2GB heap, flock concurrency, post-deploy QA. Tested and working.

### Social Poster Fixes (CEO)
- Duplicate content fix: X posting stuck in infinite 403 loop. Fixed to skip rejected posts.
- Interval optimization: Reduced X interval to 15 min, Bluesky to 10 min.

### Operations Quality Audit Acknowledged
- 17 `:latest` Docker tags fixed (good)
- 612 short meta descriptions: **DEFERRED** — will bake 155-char minimum into writer CLAUDE.md files for new content, batch fix existing in Month 2

## Update: Marketing Engagement Results (15:00 UTC)

Marketing's first full engagement iteration. All daily targets exceeded:

| Target | Required | Achieved | Status |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Follows | 10+/day | 41 (27 Mastodon + 14 Bluesky) | EXCEEDED |
| Replies | 5+/day | 8 (5 Mastodon + 3 Bluesky) | EXCEEDED |
| Original posts (non-link) | 3+/day | 30 queued + 8 Dev.to articles | EXCEEDED |
| Reddit comments | 2+/day | 0 | BLOCKED (policy wall) |

**Dev.to cross-posting:** 8 new articles published (13 total) with canonical_url backlinks. Prioritized niche comparisons and hardware guides per BI data.

**Mastodon account status:** 4 followers, 25 following, 23+ posts. Community engagement is genuine — discussing S3 alternatives, Nextcloud upgrades, Proxmox, Docker management.

## Update: Newsletter Pipeline Complete (16:45 UTC)

**Founder directive #25 (newsletter subscribe broken): COMPLETE.**

Technology delivered a full subscribe/unsubscribe pipeline:
- Subscribe: `https://selfhosting.sh/api/subscribe` — CF Pages Function → VPS portal → JSON storage
- Unsubscribe: `https://selfhosting.sh/api/unsubscribe` — CAN-SPAM/GDPR compliant
- Sending: `bin/send-newsletter.sh` — reads subscribers, sends via Resend API, rate-limited
- EmailSignup.astro: JS-enhanced with inline success/error, no-JS fallback

Marketing has been consulted on content strategy (frequency, format, promotion, targets). Awaiting response.

### Optional API Upgrades (Requires: human)

Neither is blocking — the current VPS-backed approach works. These would enable better architecture in the future:

| Item | Current State | What's Needed | Impact |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Resend API key** | Send-only (401 on contacts/audiences endpoints) | Generate new key with full access at resend.com/api-keys | Would enable: double opt-in confirmation emails, contact management via Resend dashboard |
| **Cloudflare API token** | DNS + Pages scope only | Add "Workers KV Storage" permission at dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens | Would enable: move subscriber storage from VPS JSON to Cloudflare KV (edge-distributed, more resilient) |

**CEO recommendation:** No rush on either. Current approach is reliable and functional. Consider upgrading when subscriber volume justifies it (100+ subscribers).

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. **GSC first clicks watch** — Feb 19-20 GSC data arrives Feb 21-22. With 15 page-1 keywords, first organic clicks are expected. This is the key inflection to confirm.
2. **Marketing: continue social engagement** — Maintain daily targets, prioritize Mastodon (best engagement). Dev.to cross-posting of top comparison articles.
3. **Marketing: newsletter content strategy + comments consultation** — Two open consultations awaiting Marketing response.
4. **Feb 22 writer restart prep** — Verify all 8 writer CLAUDE.md files ready, reset wake-on.conf from 48h to 1h, confirm coordinator config allows writers.
5. **Content strategy refinement** — GSC data confirms comparisons rank fastest. Ensure Feb 22 writer restart heavily prioritizes niche comparison content across all categories.
