# Board Report — 2026-02-20 (Updated 09:15 UTC)

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 5. 651 articles published (revised target: 1,500 by Feb 28 — board approved). Need ~106/day for 8 days — achievable. 2 page-1 keywords. First Bluesky follower. **All 4 founder directives from this morning have been processed:** (1) Month 1 target revised to 1,500 across all files, (2) human dependency audit delivered with step-by-step instructions, (3) Playwright-first policy cascaded to all 5 department heads, (4) Investor Relations department created and tasked with portal spec. Fixed X/Twitter posting stuck in duplicate content loop. System unpaused, 3 agents running.

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | **1,500+** (revised) | 651 | **43.4%** — need ~106/day for 8 days. On track. |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 2 confirmed | On track — only 5 days since first impressions |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | ~0 clicks (24 impressions) | Early — GSC data lags 2-3 days |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | On track — no revenue expected yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 0 | Behind — cross-posting blocked pending credentials |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | 1 | Behind — first Bluesky follower! Posting live on X + Bluesky only |

## Actions Taken This Iteration (responding to founder directive)

### 1. Technology CLAUDE.md Updated
Added "MANDATORY DISCIPLINE" section to `agents/technology/CLAUDE.md` enforcing:
- Inbox processing at start of every iteration with logged confirmation
- Log entry at end of every iteration (no exceptions)
- Prohibition on modifying infrastructure scripts without CEO directive
- Priority-based inbox processing (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)

### 2. Technology Inbox Consolidated
Cleared 12 stale messages. Replaced with single prioritized directive:
- 4 items marked RESOLVED (search, Playwright MCP, dashboard, QA) — Technology should confirm in its log
- 1 HIGH item: Investigate GSC sitemap warnings
- 1 MEDIUM item: Verify auto-deploy of 40 new AI/ML + Search Engines articles

### 3. Technology Status — Actually Better Than Feared
Technology's `strategy.md` (updated Feb 20) reveals it DID complete:
- Playwright MCP installed (`@playwright/mcp@0.0.68` with Chromium)
- Status dashboard live at `:8080` as systemd service
- Post-deploy QA script (`bin/post-deploy-qa.sh`) integrated into auto-deploy
- GSC sitemap investigated (API shows 0 warnings; resubmitted with 649 URLs)

The problem was not inaction — it was **failure to log and communicate**. The CLAUDE.md update addresses this directly.

### 4. Writer Pipeline Status
- `proxy-docker-writer`: Completed AI/ML + Search Engines (40 articles). Already reassigned to Newsletters & File Sharing.
- `vpn-filesync-writer`: Running (first iteration)
- `tier2-writer`: Last ran 05:45 UTC, producing content
- 5 more writers queued, rotating in as slots open (max 4 concurrent)

## Founder Directives — Processed This Update (09:15 UTC)

### 1. Month 1 Target → 1,500 ✓ DONE
Board-approved revision applied to all files: CLAUDE.md scorecard, strategy.md, all 4 dept CLAUDE.md files, topic-map, state.md. 5,000 moves to Month 2.

### 2. Human Dependency Audit ✓ DONE
Complete audit at `board/human-dependency-audit-2026-02-20.md`. Step-by-step instructions for 6 items. Items 1-4 (Mastodon, Dev.to, Reddit, GA4 API) take ~8 minutes total.

### 3. Playwright-First Policy ✓ DONE
Cascaded to all 5 department CLAUDE.md files (Technology, Marketing, Operations, BI-Finance, Investor Relations).

### 4. Investor Relations Department ✓ DONE
Created `agents/investor-relations/` with full CLAUDE.md, inbox, and wake-on.conf. Welcome directive sent. IR will: (1) design portal spec, (2) send to Technology for build, (3) switch to weekly cadence once portal is live.

### 5. Social Poster Fix (CEO-initiated)
X/Twitter was stuck in infinite duplicate content loop since 07:23 UTC — same post rejected as duplicate, never removed, tried again every 5 min. Fixed social-poster.js to skip 403 posts and try next. Bluesky continues working.

## Decisions Requiring Approval
None — all directives have been processed.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

### 1. Social Media Credentials — 5 Platforms Still Blocked
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16, re-escalated Feb 20)

| Platform | What's Needed | Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Mastodon** | Log into mastodon.social as @selfhostingsh, Preferences > Development > New Application > generate access token with `read write` scopes. Update MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN in api-keys.env | FOSS community reach blocked |
| **Dev.to** | Log into dev.to > Settings > Extensions > Generate API Key. Update DEVTO_API_KEY in api-keys.env | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **Reddit** | Create OAuth app at reddit.com/prefs/apps/ (script type) for u/selfhostingsh. Update REDDIT_CLIENT_ID and REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET | Community engagement blocked |
| **Hashnode** | Log into Hashnode > Settings > Developer > Generate PAT. Update HASHNODE_API_TOKEN | Backlinks via cross-posting blocked |
| **LinkedIn** | Create LinkedIn Developer App linked to company page (ID: 111603639). Apply for Marketing Developer Platform access | Professional audience blocked |

**Priority:** Mastodon > Dev.to > Reddit > Hashnode > LinkedIn

### 2. GA4 API Access
**Status:** AWAITING RESPONSE (originally escalated Feb 16)
Enable GA4 Data API and Admin API on GCP project `selfhosting-sh`. Need numeric GA4 property ID (not measurement ID G-DPDC7W5VET). Without this, BI cannot track traffic.

### 3. Amazon Associates Signup
**Status:** Not yet started. Requires tax info + identity verification. Should begin when we have meaningful traffic.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$15.83/month (Hetzner CPX21 upgraded to 8GB RAM + domain amortized)

## Key Risks

1. **Content velocity vs revised target.** 651 articles vs 1,500 target (43.4%). Need ~106/day. Achievable if writers sustain ~14/hr active rate. 2 writers running now, more queued.

2. **Social platform reach limited.** Only X and Bluesky active. 5 platforms blocked pending credentials. 1 follower. Queue has 1,924 posts. X was stuck on duplicate content — fix applied.

3. **Zero clicks from Google.** 24 impressions, 0 clicks. Expected at this stage (day 4-5 of indexing) but CTR will need attention once impressions grow. May need title/description optimization.

4. **Technology communication gap resolved.** CLAUDE.md updated with mandatory discipline rules. Will monitor next iteration for compliance.

## Key Fixes Applied This Iteration

### Writer Fallback Interval Fix
The `writerFallbackHours: 1` setting in `coordinator-config.json` was **dead code** — the coordinator's `checkFallbacks()` function reads `wake-on.conf` files per agent, not the central config. All 8 writer `wake-on.conf` files said `fallback: 8h`. Fixed: updated all to `fallback: 1h`. Five writers that have been idle since ~02:00 UTC will now restart within the hour instead of waiting until ~10:00 UTC.

### Social Poster Interval Fix
Social poster was posting only ~16 posts over 6.5 hours despite 1,933 posts in queue. Root cause: `min_interval_minutes` was 60 for X and 30 for Bluesky, so most 5-minute cycles did nothing (64% "0 attempted"). Reduced X to 15 min, Bluesky to 10 min. Expected throughput: ~240 posts/day (up from ~59). Queue drain: ~8 days (down from 33 days).

### Social Poster Duplicate Content Fix (09:15 UTC)
X/Twitter posting stuck since 07:23 UTC — every 5-min cycle hit "403 duplicate content" on the same post, never advancing to fresh posts. Fixed social-poster.js to: (1) detect 403/duplicate errors, (2) remove the rejected post from queue, (3) try the next post. This unblocks X posting.

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. **Verify X posting resumed** — After social poster fix, confirm fresh posts are going through to X
2. **Monitor writer production** — 2 writers running now, more queued. Target: ~106 articles/day to hit 1,500 by Feb 28
3. **IR portal spec** — Investor Relations should produce portal spec this iteration, send to Technology
4. **Monitor GSC indexing** — Expect new impression data by Feb 21-22 for articles submitted Feb 19-20
5. **Social credentials** — Step-by-step audit delivered. Awaiting founder action on Mastodon, Dev.to, Reddit, GA4 API
6. **Writer rotation** — As writers complete categories, ensure smooth reassignment to new ones
