# Board Report — 2026-02-21

*Updated 10:15 UTC — replaces 04:16 UTC version to reflect founder directives received 09:22 UTC.*

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 6. All three founder directives executed within one iteration. Indexing investigation complete — 4 technical fixes deployed (sitemap lastmod, 9,893 trailing slash links, www→apex redirect, RSS autodiscovery). 8 of 10 top pages confirmed indexed by Google. Writers paused until Feb 26 6PM UTC per directive. 780 articles on disk vs 850 revised target — need 70 more in 2 days with 1 writer. Mastodon surging: 123 followers at 0.77 followers/post.

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | **850+** (revised from 1,500) | 780 | 92% — writers PAUSED until Feb 26. Need ~70 in 2 days with 1 writer. Achievable. |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 16 (Feb 18 data — GSC lag) | Behind — Feb 19+ data expected Feb 22-23 |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | 103 users / 131 sessions (GA4, Feb 16-21) | Behind but accelerating. Feb 20 was best day (52 users). |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | On track — no revenue expected yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 5 | Behind — growing organically |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | 137 (Mastodon: 123, Bluesky: 14) | Behind target — Mastodon growth accelerating |

## Founder Directive Execution (09:22 UTC directive)

### 1. Month 1 target lowered to 850, subsequent -20%
**Status: DONE.** Scorecard updated across CLAUDE.md, state.md, strategy.md. All 4 departments notified. New targets: M1=850, M3=8,000, M6=12,000, M9=14,400, M12=16,000.

### 2. Google indexing investigation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status: COMPLETE — 4 fixes deployed and live.**

Root causes identified:
1. **No `<lastmod>` in sitemap** — FIXED. All 790 URLs now have lastmod dates.
2. **9,893 internal links missing trailing slashes** — FIXED. Eliminates crawl-budget-wasting 308 redirects.
3. **www.selfhosting.sh serving content instead of redirecting** — FIXED. 301 redirect via CF Pages middleware.
4. **RSS autodiscovery tag missing** — FIXED. `<link rel="alternate">` in every page `<head>`.
5. **428 articles published on day 1** — Cannot undo. New-domain + massive content spike triggers Google's quality filters.

**Indexing status** (GSC URL Inspection API, 10:10 UTC):
- 8 of 10 top pages: **INDEXED** (crawled Feb 17-19)
- Homepage (`/`): "URL is unknown to Google" — no technical blockers found (sitemap present, canonical correct, no noindex). Simply hasn't been crawled yet on this 6-day-old domain. Inspection request submitted to trigger crawl.
- `/foundations/getting-started/`: "Discovered - currently not indexed" — in queue.

**Tracking plan:** Compare Feb 22-26 GSC data (post-fix) against Feb 16-21 baseline. Key metrics: pages indexed, impressions/day, crawl coverage breadth.

**Google Indexing API:** Attempted but SERVICE_DISABLED on GCP project. Not critical — sitemap + URL Inspection are the standard mechanisms. Indexing API is officially for JobPosting/BroadcastEvent structured data only.

### 3. Writer pause extended to Feb 26 6PM UTC, 1 writer limit
**Status: DONE.** All 8 wake-on.conf updated to 130h fallback. Feb 22 `at` job cancelled. New `at` job (#2) confirmed for Feb 26 18:00 UTC. maxWriterConcurrent: 1 (already set). Operations approved `tier2-writer` as first writer — covers 7 categories for maximum breadth.

## Decisions Requiring Approval
None.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

**Enable Google Indexing API (OPTIONAL, LOW PRIORITY)**
- **Requested by:** CEO
- **What:** Enable "Web Search Indexing API" on GCP project 13850483084
- **URL:** https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/indexing.googleapis.com/overview?project=13850483084
- **Cost:** Free
- **Why:** Would allow programmatic indexing requests for new pages. Not critical — sitemap and URL Inspection API cover our needs. Google may also reject requests for pages without JobPosting/BroadcastEvent schema.
- **Impact if deferred:** None. Sitemap is working.

Previously pending items unchanged: Amazon Associates, LinkedIn API approval.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$15.83/month (Hetzner CPX21 + domain amortized)

## Key Risks
1. **Homepage not indexed (MEDIUM)** — 6-day-old domain, Google hasn't crawled homepage yet despite it being in sitemap. URL Inspection request submitted. Should resolve within days.
2. **Content velocity on Feb 26-28 (LOW)** — Need ~70 articles in ~2 days with 1 writer. Previous single-writer peak was 50-80/day. Tight but achievable. `tier2-writer` covers 7 categories for maximum output flexibility.
3. **Mastodon re-revocation (LOW-MEDIUM)** — Engagement limits imposed, bot flag set. 123 followers growing at 0.77/post. Monitoring closely.
4. **Social followers significantly behind (INFORMATIONAL)** — 137 total vs 1,000+ target. Mastodon is our best channel. Consider whether 1,000 is realistic for Month 1 without paid promotion.

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. **Monitor social posting** — Verify all platforms posting normally
2. **Check GSC data** — Feb 19 data should appear by Feb 22
3. **Prepare Feb 26 writer restart** — Verify `at` job, confirm `tier2-writer` CLAUDE.md is ready
4. **No board report needed until Feb 22** — next report will cover Feb 22 data
