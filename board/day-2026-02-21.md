# Board Report — 2026-02-21

*Updated 18:00 UTC — evening update with reply strategy overhaul and Mastodon incident response.*

## Business Health (30-second summary)
Day 6. Three founder directives from morning executed. Afternoon: analyzed Mastodon thread where our bot reply triggered public callout from Joe Ressington (Late Night Linux, 3,455 followers). Founder approved comprehensive reply strategy overhaul — 6 mandatory rules now deployed to Marketing + brand-voice.md. Operations updated all 8 writer CLAUDE.md files with article structure variation (founder-approved anti-"AI slop" measure). Mastodon automated posting remains disabled (3 app revocations). All indexing fixes live. Writer error counters reset for clean Feb 26 restart.

## Scorecard vs Target
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Articles published | **850+** (revised from 1,500) | 780 | 92% — writers PAUSED until Feb 26. Need ~70 in 2 days with 1 writer. Achievable. |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 16 (Feb 18 data — GSC lag) | Behind — Feb 19+ data expected Feb 22-23 |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | 103 users / 131 sessions (GA4, Feb 16-21) | Behind but accelerating. Feb 20 was best day (52 users). |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | On track — no revenue expected yet |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 5 | Behind — growing organically |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | ~137 (Mastodon: 126, Bluesky: ~14) | Behind target — Mastodon disabled, X+Bluesky continue |

## Founder Directive Execution

### Morning directives (09:22 UTC) — All DONE
1. **Month 1 target lowered to 850, subsequent -20%** — Updated across all files.
2. **Google indexing investigation** — 4 fixes deployed: sitemap lastmod, 9,893 trailing slash links, www→apex redirect, RSS autodiscovery. 8/10 top pages indexed.
3. **Writer pause extended to Feb 26 6PM UTC, 1 writer limit** — All 8 wake-on.conf set. `at` job confirmed.

### Afternoon directives (17:26 + 17:44 UTC) — All DONE
4. **Mastodon thread analysis** (17:26 UTC) — CEO analyzed the @awfulwoman thread on indieweb.social. Our Marketing agent made two contextually wrong replies (recommended Immich for an ActivityPub question, mentioned RAM irrelevantly). Thread escalated to public bot callout. Joe Ressington (@joeress, 3,455 followers, Late Night Linux) called site "vibe slop." Full root cause analysis delivered.

5. **Reply strategy overhaul approved** (17:44 UTC) — Founder approved all CEO recommendations. Six mandatory rules deployed:
   - No queued/batched replies — real-time or nothing
   - Full thread reading before any reply
   - Sarcasm/hostility auto-SKIP
   - "Would a human reply?" test
   - Never recommend off-target content
   - Max 1-2 replies/day (down from 5+)

6. **Article structure variation** (founder-approved option 3 from "AI slop" analysis) — Operations confirmed all 8 writer CLAUDE.md files updated. Articles will vary section ordering and opening paragraphs to reduce template uniformity.

## Decisions Requiring Approval
None.

## Escalations Requiring Human Action

**Enable Google Indexing API (OPTIONAL, LOW PRIORITY)**
- **Requested by:** CEO
- **What:** Enable "Web Search Indexing API" on GCP project 13850483084
- **Cost:** Free
- **Impact if deferred:** None. Sitemap is working.

Previously pending items unchanged: Amazon Associates, LinkedIn API approval.

## Spend
- API this month: covered by DV allocation
- Tools this month: $0 / $200
- VPS: ~$15.83/month (Hetzner CPX21 + domain amortized)

## Key Risks
1. **Reputational risk in Fediverse/Linux community (MEDIUM)** — Joe Ressington's "vibe slop" comment and the bot callout thread. Cannot be undone. Mitigated by: (a) Mastodon posting disabled, (b) strict reply rules deployed, (c) article structure variation to reduce "AI" perception. The audience we're optimizing for (Google searchers) won't see this thread.
2. **Homepage not indexed (MEDIUM)** — 6-day-old domain, Google hasn't crawled homepage yet. URL Inspection request submitted.
3. **Content velocity on Feb 26-28 (LOW)** — Need ~70 articles in ~2 days with 1 writer. Achievable. Writer error counters reset for clean restart.
4. **Social followers significantly behind (INFORMATIONAL)** — ~137 total vs 1,000+ target. Mastodon (our best channel) is disabled. Realistic Month 1 target may need revision.

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. **Monitor X + Bluesky posting** — Only active social channels now
2. **Check GSC data** — Feb 19 data should appear by Feb 22
3. **Quiet day** — Writers paused, indexing fixes deployed, reply strategy deployed. System in steady state until Feb 26.
