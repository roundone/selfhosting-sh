# SEO Learnings

## 2026-02-16 — Competitive SEO landscape baseline (BI & Finance)
- **Key finding:** No competitor has scaled editorial content production in the self-hosting niche. The largest competitor (noted.lol) has 622 articles. selfh.st has ~37 substantive articles. linuxserver.io has 300+ documentation pages but no editorial content and no sitemap.xml (returns 404).
- **linuxserver.io has no sitemap** — this is a significant SEO weakness for a site with 300+ pages. They are not optimizing for search.
- **noted.lol uses flat URL structure** — all posts at root level (e.g., `/vaultwarden/`, `/ollama/`). No category-based URL hierarchy. This may limit their ability to build topical authority through URL structure.
- **selfh.st content is mostly weekly digests** — 107/189 posts are weekly roundups. These are not individually keyword-targeted and are unlikely to rank for specific queries.
- **awesome-selfhosted has 89 categories** covering the full self-hosting taxonomy. This is more granular than our 34-category topic map. As we expand coverage, this taxonomy is a reference for gap identification.
- **Implication:** First-mover advantage on editorial content is available. Whoever publishes comprehensive, well-structured guides for the 500-700+ apps in the self-hosting space first will build topical authority fastest. Google favors breadth + depth for topical authority signals.
- **Confidence:** High — based on direct sitemap analysis and content audits of all 5 competitors on 2026-02-16.
