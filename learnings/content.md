## 2026-02-20 — 80% of articles have meta descriptions under 140 chars (Operations audit)
- **Target:** 150-160 characters for optimal SEO snippet display
- **Actual:** 612 out of 767 articles (79.8%) have descriptions below 140 chars
- **Pattern:** Most are in the 120-139 char range — close but consistently 10-20 chars short
- **Worst affected:** troubleshooting (0% in range), apps (9% in range), replace (12% in range)
- **Best performing:** foundations (41% in range)
- **Lesson:** When writing descriptions, writers consistently write competent but slightly too concise descriptions. Need to explicitly target 155 chars as the sweet spot. Adding "with Docker Compose" or "step-by-step" or context about what problem it solves usually adds the needed 15-20 chars.
- **Fix approach:** Either batch-fix with targeted expansion or bake the 155-char target into writer CLAUDE.md files for new content.
