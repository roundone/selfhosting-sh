# Competitive Intelligence Baseline — 2026-02-16

## Summary

The self-hosting content space has no dominant editorial player. The largest competitor (noted.lol) has 622 posts — an order of magnitude below our 5,000+ month-1 target. There is a massive content gap waiting to be filled.

## Competitor Profiles

### 1. selfh.st

**Type:** Newsletter/community brand
**Total content:** ~221 URLs (only ~37 substantive articles)
**SEO threat:** Low

- Heavy reliance on weekly newsletter digests (107 of 189 posts since Feb 2023)
- ~32 blog posts + 5 alternatives guides = thin editorial library
- Has apps directory, icon library, podcast, membership model
- Strength: consistent weekly cadence, community features
- Weakness: very thin article library — mostly digests, not deep content

### 2. noted.lol (formerly noted-apps.com)

**Type:** Self-hosting content site (strongest direct competitor)
**Total content:** ~658 URLs (622 content posts)
**SEO threat:** Medium-High

- ~280 app reviews/spotlights (~45% of content)
- ~120 tutorial/how-to guides (~20%)
- ~100 infrastructure/platform articles
- ~35 roundup/collection articles
- 53 content category tags covering the self-hosting taxonomy
- Flat URL structure (all posts at root level — no SEO hierarchy)
- Monetization: shop, sponsors, donations, membership
- Strength: largest article count among competitors, good topic coverage
- Weakness: still only 622 articles, flat URLs hurt SEO

### 3. linuxserver.io

**Type:** Docker image provider + documentation
**Total content:** 300+ app documentation pages, 280+ Docker images
**SEO threat:** Low (for editorial content)

- De facto standard for Docker images in the self-hosting space
- Content is Docker image documentation, not editorial/guide content
- No comparison articles, "best of" roundups, or opinionated guides
- No sitemap.xml (returns 404) — significant SEO weakness
- Multiple subdomains: docs.linuxserver.io, info.linuxserver.io
- Community: Discord + Discourse forum
- Strength: standard Docker image source, 300+ apps documented
- Weakness: no editorial content, no SEO optimization

### 4. awesome-selfhosted (GitHub)

**Type:** Curated directory/reference list
**Total content:** 500-700+ apps across 89 categories
**SEO threat:** Low (for search queries)

- 273,457 GitHub stars — one of the most popular repos on GitHub
- 89 distinct categories — most comprehensive categorization of self-hosting space
- Actively maintained (updated daily, zero open issues)
- Companion site: awesome-selfhosted.net (browsable version)
- Not a content site — no guides, tutorials, comparisons, or editorial
- Strength: canonical app index, excellent content planning resource
- Weakness: not an editorial competitor

### 5. r/selfhosted (Reddit community)

**Type:** Community forum/wiki
**Subscribers:** Data unavailable (Reddit API requires OAuth, public endpoint blocked)
**SEO threat:** Medium (Reddit ranks for many long-tail queries)

- Community-driven content, not structured editorial
- Wiki serves as a lightweight reference
- Hot/trending posts reveal user interest and emerging apps
- Strength: organic community discussion, Google indexes Reddit
- Weakness: unstructured, not optimized for SEO

## Competitive Matrix

| Competitor | Articles | Content Type | SEO Threat | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| selfh.st | ~37 | Newsletter/digest | Low | Weekly consistency | Thin article library |
| noted.lol | 622 | Reviews/tutorials | Medium-High | Largest content library | Still only 622 articles |
| linuxserver.io | 300+ docs | Docker image docs | Low | Standard Docker images | No editorial content |
| awesome-selfhosted | 500-700+ listings | Curated directory | Low | 273K stars, 89 categories | Not a content site |
| r/selfhosted | N/A | Community forum | Medium | Organic discussion | Unstructured |

## Strategic Implications

1. **No one has scaled content production.** The largest competitor has 622 articles. Our 5,000+ month-1 target would make us 8x larger than any competitor on day 30.

2. **The 89-category taxonomy from awesome-selfhosted is the content map.** Our 34-category topic map covers the highest-value segments. Over time, we should expand toward their full 89 categories.

3. **linuxserver.io is a partnership opportunity, not a competitor.** Their Docker images are what our guides install. Referencing their images in our content creates natural interlinking and potentially referral traffic.

4. **noted.lol is the one to watch.** They have the most editorial content and decent category coverage. Monitor their content production velocity and keyword overlap.

5. **Reddit ranks for queries we want.** Many "best self-hosted X" and "how to self-host X" queries show Reddit in top results. Our content must be significantly better than community posts to displace them.
