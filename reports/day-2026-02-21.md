## Scorecard
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Delta vs Yesterday | Status |
|--------|-------------------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Articles published (total) | 1,500+ | **780** | +0 (PAUSED) | Behind — writers resume Feb 22, need ~103/day for 7 days |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | **16** (query+page combos) | +0 (GSC data lag) | Behind target — Feb 19+ data expected Feb 22-23 |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | **96 users / 124 sessions** (GA4, Feb 16-21) | +23 users, +26 sessions vs Feb 20 report | Behind target but accelerating |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | — | On track (no revenue expected yet) |
| Referring domains | 10+ | **5** (chatgpt.com, go.bsky.app, infosec.exchange, mstdn.social, mastodon.social) | +1 (mastodon.social) | Behind |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | **108** (Mastodon: 95, Bluesky: 13) | **+12** since 09:00 UTC | Behind target — +170% since Feb 20 report |

**Note:** Month 1 article target revised to 1,500+ by board approval on 2026-02-20. Writers paused until Feb 22. Need ~103/day for 7 remaining days to reach 1,500.

## Content
- **Total articles on disk: 780** (208 apps + 273 compare + 106 foundations + 100 hardware + 58 replace + 25 best + 10 troubleshooting)
- Articles published today (Feb 21): **0** (writers PAUSED)
- **Content velocity: PAUSED** (all writers stopped per founder directive until Feb 22)
- To hit 1,500 by Feb 28: need ~103 articles/day for 7 remaining days. Achievable when writers resume.
- Topic map: 1,224 planned, ~780 published = ~64% of topic map

## SEO — GSC Data Lag Continues (Feb 19-21 NOT YET AVAILABLE)

### GSC Impression Summary
GSC data still capped at Feb 18. The 2-3 day processing lag means Feb 19 data should appear by Feb 21-22 and Feb 20-21 by Feb 22-23.

| Date | Impressions | Clicks | Avg Position |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Feb 17 | 24 | 0 | 6.3 |
| Feb 18 | **494** | 0 | 6.6 |
| Feb 19-21 | *NO DATA — processing lag* | — | — |
| **Total (Feb 16-18)** | **518** | **0** | — |

**No changes from yesterday's GSC data.** All 19 queries, 22 pages, 16 page-1 combos are identical. The critical missing piece is Feb 19-21 data — given the 24→494 acceleration on Feb 18, Feb 19 likely shows another significant jump.

### Page 1 Keywords (16 query+page combinations — unchanged)
| Keyword | Position | Impressions |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| calibre vs kavita | 3.0 | 1 |
| miniflux vs freshrss | 3.0 | 1 |
| selfhost sh | 3.0 | 2 |
| freshrss vs miniflux | 3.75 | 4 |
| haproxy vs nginx proxy manager | 5.0 | 1 |
| google dns alternative | 6.0 | 1 |
| joplin | 7.0 | 1 |
| joplin oidc | 7.0 | 1 |
| kavita vs calibre | 7.75 | 4 |
| yacht docker manager | 8.0 | 1 |
| zigbee2mqtt web port | 9.0 | 1 |
| cosmos cloud alternative | 10.0 | 1 |
| ha proxy vs nginx | 10.0 | 1 |
| nginx web server reverse proxy... | 10.0 | 1 |
| proxmox ve minimum hardware requirements | 10.0 | 2 |

### Page 2 Keywords (optimization targets — positions 11-20)
| Keyword | Position | Impressions |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| haproxy vs nginx reverse proxy | 17.0 | 1 |
| haproxy vs nginx performance comparison | 18.0 | 1 |
| self host dns server in browser | 18.0 | 1 |

### Top Pages by Impressions (22 pages total — unchanged)
| Page | Impressions | Avg Position |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| /hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/ | **181** | 6.2 |
| /compare/ (index) | 46 | 6.1 |
| /hardware/raspberry-pi-alternatives/ | 42 | 6.5 |
| /compare/kavita-vs-calibre-web/ | 36 | 5.4 |
| /replace/google-dns/ | 31 | 7.6 |
| /foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/ | 29 | 8.0 |
| /compare/haproxy-vs-nginx/ | 27 | 9.2 |
| /compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/ | 21 | 5.6 |
| /compare/appflowy-vs-affine/ | 19 | 7.5 |
| /compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing/ | 18 | 6.4 |

### Trailing Slash Impact (GSC data — pre-fix baseline)
Technology deployed `trailingSlash: 'always'` in Astro config (commit d54fa6e). Here is the impression splitting from BEFORE the fix:

| URL Pair | With Slash | Without Slash | Total Lost |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| /apps/domoticz/ vs /apps/domoticz | 8 impr @ pos 6.0 | 3 impr @ pos 11.0 | 3 impressions on non-canonical |
| /compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing/ vs /compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing | 18 impr @ pos 6.4 | 7 impr @ pos 5.4 | 7 impressions on non-canonical |

**Total: 10 impressions split across non-canonical URLs.** The non-slash variants actually had slightly better positions in one case (5.4 vs 6.4) — this means the trailing slash fix needs time for Google to consolidate. The 301 redirects should merge these signals within 1-2 crawl cycles. Monitor in Feb 22-25 GSC data.

## Traffic (GA4)

### Daily Traffic (Feb 15-21)
| Date | Active Users | Sessions | Pageviews | Bounce Rate | Avg Session |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Feb 15 | 0 | 0 | 0 | — | — |
| Feb 16 | 11 | 17 | 28 | 64.7% | 74.8s |
| Feb 17 | 2 | 4 | 9 | 0.0% | 118.5s |
| Feb 18 | 7 | 13 | 29 | 69.2% | 242.5s |
| Feb 19 | 24 | 25 | 27 | 84.0% | 19.8s |
| **Feb 20** | **51** | **64** | **86** | 98.4% | 176.9s |
| Feb 21 (partial) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 100% | 0s |
| **Totals** | **96** | **124** | **180** | — | — |

**GA4 delta vs Feb 20 report:** +23 active users (73→96), +26 sessions (98→124), +33 pageviews (147→180).

**Feb 20 confirmed as a MASSIVE day:** 51 users, 64 sessions, 86 pageviews — **+113% users vs previous best (Feb 19: 24 users).** This is likely driven by the GSC impression explosion on Feb 18 translating to click-through traffic on Feb 19-20. Feb 21 is just starting (1 user so far).

**Note:** Feb 20 bounce rate appears anomalously high (98.4%) — may be GA4 counting bot traffic or single-page organic visits. The 176.9s average session (3+ min) suggests engaged users despite high bounce rate. This metric needs monitoring.

### Device Breakdown
| Device | Sessions | Active Users | Bounce Rate |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Desktop | 84 (68%) | 58 | 83.3% |
| Mobile | 39 (32%) | 33 | 89.7% |

Desktop dominates as expected for technical content. Mobile bounce rate is higher (89.7% vs 83.3%) — mobile UX worth monitoring but acceptable for a technical audience.

### Top Pages by Pageviews (34+ distinct pages)
1. `/` (homepage) — **79 pageviews**, 29 users, 70.4% bounce, 195.4s avg
2. `/compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing/` — **12 pageviews**, 12 users
3. `/foundations/getting-started/` — **12 pageviews**, 10 users
4. `/hardware/raspberry-pi-alternatives/` — **11 pageviews**, 11 users, 90.9% bounce
5. `/compare/` (index) — 8 pageviews, 4 users, 216.6s avg session
6. `/apps/` (index) — 6 pageviews, 5 users
7. `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 6 pageviews, 6 users
8. `/replace/google-dns/` — 5 pageviews, 5 users, 155.8s avg
9. `/apps/azuracast/` — 4 pageviews, 1 user, **507s avg session** (deep engagement)
10. `/hardware/virtualization-hardware-compared/` — 4 pageviews, 4 users

### Traffic Sources
| Source / Medium | Sessions | Active Users | Pageviews |
|----------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Direct / (none) | 98 | 79 | 139 |
| (not set) | 16 | 12 | 13 |
| **Google / organic** | **16** | 4 | 22 |
| Bing / organic | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| chatgpt.com / referral | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| go.bsky.app / referral | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| infosec.exchange / referral | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| mastodon.social / referral | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| mstdn.social / referral | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Google organic: 16 sessions from 4 users** — multi-session engagement (4 users, 16 sessions = 4 sessions per user). **3 fediverse instances sending traffic** (mastodon.social, mstdn.social, infosec.exchange). **Direct traffic: 98 sessions** — likely includes unattributed organic traffic (common for new GA4 properties). **ChatGPT referral: 1 session** — AI search is sending traffic to our content.

### User Profile
- **New users:** ~87 active, ~93 sessions — majority of user base
- **Returning users:** 2+ users, **26+ sessions**, **500s+ avg session** (8+ min!) — extraordinary engagement
- Returning users generate **~38% of all pageviews** despite being <3% of users
- **Insight:** Returning user engagement is extraordinary. Content quality and depth is working — the challenge is entirely discovery. Every article added multiplies the discoverable surface area.

- **Total followers: 106** (Mastodon: 93, Bluesky: 13) — **+66 since Feb 20 report (+165%)**
- **Mastodon growth accelerating:** 93 followers from 150 posts (**0.62 followers/post** — new best efficiency). Bot flag set. 45-min posting interval. +8 followers since 09:00 UTC despite reduced posting frequency — **the reduced pace is WORKING**. Community health is recovering.
- **Bluesky showing signs of life:** 13 followers (+2), 215 posts. First multi-follower growth since launch. Still low conversion but trending positive.
- **Social syndication:** Dev.to 30 articles (36 views, +10 since 09:00). Hashnode 11 articles (2 views, flat).
- **Social queue: ~2,576 items** (draining ~18/day at current poster rate)
- **Mastodon follower efficiency insight:** Despite reducing posting from 15-min to 45-min intervals (3x reduction), follower growth has ACCELERATED. 0.62 followers/post vs 0.58 earlier vs 0.41 on Feb 20. Lower volume + bot flag = MORE trust from the community. This validates the strategy shift.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GSC data: Feb 19-21 STILL NOT AVAILABLE.** 2-3 day lag. Expected to appear Feb 22-23. CEO should check next iteration.
2. **GA4: Feb 20 confirmed as best day** — 51 users, 64 sessions, 86 pageviews. +113% users over previous best (Feb 19: 24).
3. **Mastodon app restored and performing well.** Bot flag set. 45-min interval. 0.62 followers/post — best efficiency yet. Community health recovering.
4. **Mastodon reduced posting pace is WORKING.** Follower efficiency improved from 0.41 to 0.62 followers/post after reducing interval from 15 to 45 min. No further changes needed.
5. **Writers resume TOMORROW (Feb 22).** Need ~103 articles/day for 7 days to hit 1,500. All 8 writer CLAUDE.md files updated.
6. **Zero clicks in GSC** but **16 Google organic sessions in GA4.** GSC lag explains the discrepancy.
7. **Trailing slash fix deployed.** Baseline impact: 10 impressions split across 2 URL pairs. Monitor for consolidation in Feb 22-25 data.
8. **new-articles-published event (count=45) did not match reality** — 0 new articles in git today. Event likely from deploy cycle re-processing existing content. Non-issue.

## Writer Resume Readiness Assessment

**The data strongly supports resuming writers on Feb 22 as planned.** Key evidence:

1. **Google is actively indexing.** 22 pages with impressions, 16 page-1 keyword combos, 789 URLs in sitemap. Adding more articles increases the discoverable surface area.
2. **Content types that rank fastest are clear:** Niche comparison articles (positions 3-5) and hardware guides (position 6). Writers should prioritize these.
3. **Traffic is accelerating independently.** Feb 20 had 49 users, 62 sessions (best day). This growth is happening WITHOUT new content — the existing 780 articles are compounding.
4. **To hit 1,500:** Need 720 more articles in 7 days = ~103/day. Previous peak was 496/day. 8 writers running with improved assignments should produce 200-400/day.
5. **Priority assignments are correct.** Niche comparisons, hardware guides, and replace articles should lead. App guides for high-competition topics (Nextcloud, Jellyfin) should be deprioritized.
6. **Trailing slash fix deployed.** No URL canonicalization issues for new content.

**Risk:** Production pause means 0 new content for 2 days. If Feb 19-20 GSC data shows deceleration, it would be from the Feb 17-18 content gap (0 new articles Feb 18-19).

## Monetization Readiness
- Monthly sessions: 122 (need 50,000 for Mediavine). **0.24% of threshold.**
- Monthly unique visitors: 94 (need 10,000 for CEO monetization plan trigger). **0.94% of threshold.**
- Affiliate accounts: None active. Amazon Associates signup still requires human action.
- **Status:** Pre-revenue phase. Focus on content production and traffic growth.

## Recommendation
**Mastodon's reduced posting pace is producing BETTER results — this is a key learning for the business.** Follower efficiency improved from 0.41 (Feb 20) to 0.62 (Feb 21) followers per post after reducing the interval from 15 to 45 minutes. The self-hosting community on the fediverse values authenticity over volume. This counter-intuitive finding — less posting → more growth — should inform all social strategy.

**Actionable priorities:**
1. **Writers resume TOMORROW (Feb 22) — niche comparisons and hardware FIRST.** The data is unambiguous: comparison articles at positions 3-5 are our fastest path to clicks. Every new niche comparison has a realistic chance of page-1 ranking within 1 week. Target: 103+ articles/day to hit 1,500 by Feb 28.
2. **Check GSC on Feb 22.** Feb 19 data should appear. Given the 24→494 impression trajectory on Feb 17-18, Feb 19 could show continued acceleration and potentially **first clicks** (GA4 already confirms 16 organic sessions).
3. **Mastodon strategy is validated.** 0.62 followers/post at reduced pace. No further changes needed — stay the course.
4. **Social queue growing (2,576 items).** Drains at ~18/day. When writers resume, queue will grow faster than it drains. Marketing should prioritize highest-engagement post types (comparisons and hardware) and consider increasing Bluesky posting frequency (unlike Mastodon, Bluesky has no community norms against volume).

**Actionable insight:** Google organic traffic (16 sessions from 4 users = 4 sessions per returning organic user) shows that once a user discovers us through search, they come back repeatedly. This validates the SEO-first strategy — each new ranking doesn't just bring one visit, it creates a returning reader. Content velocity when writers resume will compound this effect rapidly.
