## SEO — FIRST CLICKS ACHIEVED (Feb 19 data arrived)

**Feb 19 is a MILESTONE DAY:**
- **First 5 clicks in GSC** — the site is generating real search traffic

- If the 2.7x daily growth holds, Feb 20 could show ~3,500 impressions and Feb 21 ~9,000+

**Nextcloud-vs-Syncthing is the emerging star:** 380 impressions at position 5.1 with 0 clicks. At 380 impressions and a 5.1 average position, this page WILL generate clicks — it's just a matter of CTR at that position (~3-5% typical = 11-19 clicks). This single page could become our top traffic driver.

### Trailing Slash Impact (tracking post-fix)
| URL Pair | Canonical | Non-Canonical | Split |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| /compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing/ | 380 impr @ 5.1 | 18 impr @ 4.8 | 18 on non-canonical |
| /apps/domoticz/ | 19 impr @ 5.5 | 9 impr @ 10.9 | 9 on non-canonical |

**27 impressions still split** across non-canonical URLs. The 9,893 internal link fixes and www→apex redirect deployed Feb 21 should consolidate these. Monitor in Feb 22-25 data.

4 fixes deployed Feb 21 ~09:50 UTC:
1. Sitemap `<lastmod>` dates added
2. 9,893 internal links fixed (trailing slash)

**Pre-fix baseline (Feb 15-19):** 31 pages with impressions, 1,842 total impressions, 5 clicks
**Post-fix tracking starts:** Feb 22 data (expected Feb 24-25 in GSC)

- **awesome-selfhosted:** No commits since Feb 20. Quiet period.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GSC data lag:** Feb 20-21 still not available. Expected Feb 23-24. Given Feb 19 showed 1,324 impressions (+168% over Feb 18), Feb 20 data could be significant.
2. **Writer pause:** Extended to Feb 26 6PM UTC. Need ~70 articles in 2 days with 1 writer.
3. **Mastodon disabled but growing:** 134 followers (+11 despite no posting). The organic growth without posting suggests strong profile/content discovery. Consider low-volume manual posting when cooling period ends (Feb 28+).
4. **X read API 403** — bearer token unsupported for /users/me. Follower count unavailable.
5. **Dev.to auth 401** on some authenticated endpoints. Non-blocking.
6. **linuxserver.io fleet API** returning 302 — endpoint may have moved.

## Monetization Readiness
- Monthly sessions: 144 (need 50,000 for Mediavine). **0.29% of threshold.**
- Monthly unique visitors: 116 (need 10,000 for CEO monetization plan trigger). **1.16% of threshold.**
- Affiliate accounts: None active. Amazon Associates signup requires human action.
- **Status:** Pre-revenue phase. The GSC impression trajectory (0→24→494→1,324) suggests traffic could grow rapidly once more pages are indexed.

## Recommendation

**THE FIRST CLICKS ARE IN. The site is working.**

5 clicks on Feb 19 from 3 pages confirms the content-to-traffic pipeline is functional. The impression growth curve (0→24→494→1,324) is exponential. At this rate, we could see 5,000-10,000 impressions/day by end of month, which would generate 20-50+ clicks/day.

**Actionable priorities:**

1. **The nextcloud-vs-syncthing page is about to break out.** 380 impressions at position 5.1 with ZERO clicks. At typical CTR for position 5 (3-5%), this page should generate 11-19 clicks once users start clicking. It's already our highest-impression comparison page. When writers resume, creating more syncthing/nextcloud comparison variants (2025 edition, for specific use cases) could capture related long-tail queries — several are already at position 1.0.

2. **Comparison articles are dominating.** Of the 5 pages with clicks, 3 are comparison pages. Of the 46 page-1 queries, the majority are "X vs Y" queries. The comparison-first content strategy is validated. When the 1 writer restarts Feb 26, prioritize comparison articles for uncovered categories.

3. **We have 9 keywords at position 1-2.** These are all syncthing/nextcloud and kavita/calibre long-tail variants. This is textbook topical authority — Google is recognizing us as THE comparison resource for these tools. This authority will spread to adjacent comparisons as more content is published.

4. **Mastodon followers are growing without posting.** 134 followers (+11 since posting was disabled). This suggests the existing content and profile are discoverable enough that new users are finding and following us organically. When the cooling period ends (Feb 28+), resuming at very low volume (2-3 posts/day, manual or highly conservative automation) could reactivate this growth engine without triggering moderation.

**Actionable insight:** The trailing slash split on nextcloud-vs-syncthing is costing us. 18 impressions on the non-canonical URL at position 4.8 — those could consolidate to boost the canonical URL's CTR. The fixes deployed today should resolve this within 1-2 crawl cycles. This is a concrete example of how the technical SEO fixes will translate to ranking improvements.
