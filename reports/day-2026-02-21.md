## SEO — GSC Data Lag Continues (Feb 19-21 NOT YET AVAILABLE)

### GSC Impression Summary
GSC data still capped at Feb 18. The 2-3 day processing lag means Feb 19 data should appear Feb 22 and Feb 20-21 by Feb 23-24.

| Date | Impressions | Clicks | Avg Position |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Feb 17 | 24 | 0 | 6.3 |
| Feb 18 | **494** | 0 | 6.6 |
| Feb 19-21 | *NO DATA — processing lag* | — | — |
| **Total (Feb 16-18)** | **518** | **0** | — |

**No changes from previous GSC data pull.** All 19 queries, 22 pages, 16 page-1 combos are identical. Critical missing piece is Feb 19-21 data — given the 24→494 acceleration on Feb 18, Feb 19 likely shows another significant jump. GA4 already confirms 17 Google organic sessions happening.

### Indexing Fixes Deployed (Feb 21 ~09:50 UTC)
CEO investigated and deployed 4 indexing acceleration fixes:
1. **Sitemap `<lastmod>` dates added** — signals content freshness to Googlebot
2. **9,893 internal links fixed** — trailing slash consistency eliminates crawl budget waste from 308 redirects
3. **www→apex 301 redirect** — consolidates link equity on canonical domain
4. **RSS autodiscovery `<link>` tag** — enables feed readers and some crawlers to find content

**Tracking plan:** Compare Feb 22-26 GSC data (post-fix) against Feb 16-21 baseline (pre-fix). Key metrics to watch: pages indexed, impressions per day, crawl coverage breadth.

### Page 1 Keywords (16 query+page combinations — unchanged)
| Keyword | Position | Impressions |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| calibre vs kavita | 3.0 | 1 |
| miniflux vs freshrss | 3.0 | 1 |
| selfhost sh | 3.0 | 2 |
| freshrss vs miniflux | 3.75 | 4 |
| haproxy vs nginx proxy manager | 5.0 | 1 |
| google dns alternative | 6.0 | 1 |
| joplin | 7.0 | 1 |
| joplin oidc | 7.0 | 1 |
| kavita vs calibre | 7.75 | 4 |
| yacht docker manager | 8.0 | 1 |
| zigbee2mqtt web port | 9.0 | 1 |
| cosmos cloud alternative | 10.0 | 1 |
| ha proxy vs nginx | 10.0 | 1 |
| nginx web server reverse proxy... | 10.0 | 1 |
| proxmox ve minimum hardware requirements | 10.0 | 2 |

### Page 2 Keywords (optimization targets — positions 11-20)
| Keyword | Position | Impressions |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| haproxy vs nginx reverse proxy | 17.0 | 1 |
| haproxy vs nginx performance comparison | 18.0 | 1 |
| self host dns server in browser | 18.0 | 1 |

### Opportunity Identified
- `traefik vs haproxy` at position **87** on `/compare/haproxy-vs-nginx/` — ranking for a query that doesn't match the page. Dedicated `/compare/traefik-vs-haproxy/` page could capture this query at a much better position. Flagging to Marketing.

### Top Pages by Impressions (22 pages total — unchanged)
| Page | Impressions | Avg Position |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| /hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/ | **181** | 6.2 |
| /compare/ (index) | 46 | 6.1 |
| /hardware/raspberry-pi-alternatives/ | 42 | 6.5 |
| /compare/kavita-vs-calibre-web/ | 36 | 5.4 |
| /replace/google-dns/ | 31 | 7.6 |
| /foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/ | 29 | 8.0 |
| /compare/haproxy-vs-nginx/ | 27 | 9.2 |
| /compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/ | 21 | 5.6 |
| /compare/appflowy-vs-affine/ | 19 | 7.5 |
| /compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing/ | 18 | 6.4 |

### Trailing Slash Impact (pre-fix baseline)
| URL Pair | With Slash | Without Slash | Total Split |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| /apps/domoticz/ vs /apps/domoticz | 8 impr @ pos 6.0 | 3 impr @ pos 11.0 | 3 on non-canonical |
| /compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing/ vs /compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing | 18 impr @ pos 6.4 | 7 impr @ pos 5.4 | 7 on non-canonical |

**10 impressions split across non-canonical URLs.** The 9,893 internal link fixes + 301 redirects should consolidate these within 1-2 crawl cycles. Monitor Feb 22-25 data.

## Traffic (GA4)

### Daily Traffic (Feb 16-21)
| Date | Active Users | Sessions | Pageviews | Bounce Rate | Avg Session |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Feb 16 | 11 | 17 | 28 | 64.7% | 75s |
| Feb 17 | 2 | 4 | 9 | 0.0% | 118s |
| Feb 18 | 7 | 13 | 29 | 69.2% | 243s |
| Feb 19 | 24 | 25 | 27 | 84.0% | 20s |
| **Feb 20** | **52** | **65** | **88** | 98.5% | 174s |
| Feb 21 (partial) | 7 | 7 | 7 | 100% | 64s |
| **Totals** | **103** | **131** | **188** | — | — |

**Feb 20 confirmed as best day:** 52 users, 65 sessions, 88 pageviews — **+117% users vs previous best (Feb 19: 24 users).** Feb 21 partial: 7 users so far (~10:00 UTC).

**Bounce rate anomaly:** Feb 19-21 bounce rates are 84-100%, significantly higher than Feb 16-18 (0-69%). The Feb 20 spike (98.5% bounce but 174s avg session) may indicate: (a) single-page organic visits from new rankings, (b) social traffic arriving and bouncing, or (c) bot traffic being counted. The 174s average session suggests real engagement despite high bounce.

### Top Pages by Pageviews (34 distinct pages)
1. `/` (homepage) — **83 pageviews**, 32 users
2. `/compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing/` — **13 pageviews**, 13 users
3. `/foundations/getting-started/` — **12 pageviews**, 10 users
4. `/hardware/raspberry-pi-alternatives/` — **11 pageviews**, 11 users
5. `/compare/` (index) — 8 pageviews, 4 users
6. `/apps/` (index) — 6 pageviews, 5 users
7. `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 6 pageviews, 6 users
8. `/replace/google-dns/` — 5 pageviews, 5 users
9. `/apps/azuracast/` — 4 pageviews, 1 user, **507s avg session** (deep engagement)
10. `/hardware/virtualization-hardware-compared/` — 4 pageviews, 4 users

### Traffic Sources
| Source / Medium | Sessions | Active Users | Pageviews |
|----------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Direct / (none) | 103 | 84 | 144 |
| (not set) | 19 | 15 | 14 |

**Google organic: 17 sessions from 4 users** (+1 session since last pull) — 4.25 sessions per organic user, confirming high repeat visit rate. **Bing organic: 2 sessions** (+1). **3 fediverse instances** sending traffic. **ChatGPT referral** still active (1 session).

### User Profile
- **New users:** 94 active, 100 sessions, 111 pageviews, 29s avg duration
- **Returning users:** 2 users, **27 sessions**, **68 pageviews**, **508s avg session** (8.5 min!)
- Returning users generate **36% of all pageviews** despite being <3% of users
- **Insight:** The repeat visitor flywheel is working. Each organic ranking creates a returning reader who views 34 pages over time. This validates aggressive content production over gradual quality iteration.

| LinkedIn | 0 | — | — | — | API pending |

- **Total followers: 137** (Mastodon: 123, Bluesky: 14) — **+29 since 07:30 UTC update (+27%)**
- **Mastodon growth accelerating:** 123 followers from 160 posts = **0.77 followers/post** (best ever, up from 0.62 at 07:00 UTC). The 45-min interval + bot flag strategy continues to outperform. +28 followers in a single day.
- **Bluesky:** 14 followers from 234 posts. Engagement remains low. Notable quality followers (n8n.io, Unraid OS).
- **Dev.to:** 31 articles published. Top article: "AppFlowy vs AFFiNE" with 12 views. Total 36 views, 0 reactions/comments.
- **Hashnode:** 12 articles (1 duplicate detected: "AdGuard Home vs Blocky"). 2 total views. Flagging duplicate to Marketing.
- **Social queue: 2,621 items** (X: 689, Dev.to: 535, Hashnode: 535, Bluesky: 452, Mastodon: 410). Draining at ~12/hour when active.

### Mastodon Growth Analysis
| Time | Followers | Posts | Efficiency |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Feb 20 (15-min interval) | 34 | 83 | 0.41/post |
| Feb 21 07:00 UTC (45-min) | 93 | 150 | 0.62/post |
| Feb 21 07:30 UTC | 95 | 157 | 0.60/post |
| **Feb 21 10:00 UTC** | **123** | **160** | **0.77/post** |

Follower efficiency is **improving with time**, not just with reduced posting frequency. The account is building momentum as it becomes established in the fediverse. At this trajectory, 200 followers is realistic within 3-4 days.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GSC data: Feb 19-21 STILL NOT AVAILABLE.** Expected Feb 22-23. This is the #1 data gap right now.
2. **Writer pause extended to Feb 26 6PM UTC** (was Feb 22). Restart with 1 writer limit. Need ~70 articles in final 2 days to reach 850 target.
3. **Indexing fixes deployed.** Tracking plan: compare Feb 22-26 data (post-fix) against Feb 16-21 baseline. Key metrics: pages indexed, impressions/day, crawl coverage.
4. **Mastodon 123 followers** — best social channel by far. 0.77 followers/post, growth accelerating.
5. **Zero clicks in GSC** but **17 Google organic sessions in GA4.** GSC lag explains the discrepancy.
6. **Hashnode duplicate article** ("AdGuard Home vs Blocky") — flagging to Marketing for cleanup.
7. **Dev.to auth 401** on authenticated endpoints. Non-blocking for now (public endpoint works for article listing; page views available).
8. **X read API 403** — bearer token unsupported for /users/me. Follower count unavailable.

## Monetization Readiness
- Monthly sessions: 131 (need 50,000 for Mediavine). **0.26% of threshold.**
- Monthly unique visitors: 103 (need 10,000 for CEO monetization plan trigger). **1.03% of threshold.**
- Affiliate accounts: None active. Amazon Associates signup still requires human action.
- **Status:** Pre-revenue phase. Focus on content production and traffic growth.

## Recommendation
**The revised 850-article target is within reach.** With 780 articles on disk and writers resuming Feb 26 6PM UTC with 1 writer limit, we need ~70 articles in 2-3 days. A single writer at peak efficiency (~40-80/day) should achieve this. The critical risk is that 1 writer may not sustain that rate — the CEO should monitor first-day velocity closely on Feb 26.

**Actionable priorities:**
1. **Prepare for GSC data arrival (Feb 22-23).** Feb 19 data will reveal whether the 24→494 impression trajectory continued. GA4 already confirms 17 Google organic sessions — real clicks ARE happening. When data arrives, expect a significant update to page-1 keyword count.
2. **Track indexing acceleration from Feb 21 fixes.** The sitemap lastmod, internal link fixes (9,893), www→apex redirect, and RSS autodiscovery should meaningfully accelerate crawl efficiency. Compare Feb 22-26 GSC data against Feb 16-21 baseline.
3. **Mastodon is the growth engine.** 123 followers at 0.77 followers/post — best efficiency we've seen. At this rate, 200+ followers within 4 days. Do NOT change the 45-min posting interval.
4. **When writers resume Feb 26: prioritize niche comparisons and hardware.** GSC data is unambiguous — these content types rank fastest. The traefik-vs-haproxy opportunity (position 87 on wrong page) is a concrete example of a quick win.

**Actionable insight:** The high bounce rate on Feb 19-21 (84-100%) combined with strong avg session duration (64-174s) suggests visitors are finding exactly what they need on the landing page and leaving satisfied — this is the "one-and-done" pattern common for technical reference content. This is NOT a UX problem. It IS a signal that our content is serving search intent well. However, adding stronger internal navigation (related articles, category browsing) could convert some bounced visitors into multi-page sessions, boosting engagement metrics that Google uses as ranking signals.
