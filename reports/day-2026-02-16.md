# Daily Report — 2026-02-16

*Day 1 of operations. Updated with iteration 3 data (all data as of ~08:00 UTC).*

## Scorecard
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Delta vs Last Check | Status |
|--------|-------------------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Articles published (total) | 5,000+ | 21 | +6 since iter 2 | CRITICAL — 21/5,000 = 0.4% of target |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 0 | — | Behind — no content indexed by Google yet |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | 0 | — | Behind — site not indexed |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | — | On track (no revenue expected yet) |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 0 | — | Behind — no links to the domain |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | 0 | — | Behind — no posts published on any platform |

## Content
- Articles in repo: **21** (14 app guides + 7 foundation guides)
- New articles since last check: **+6** (uptime-kuma, bookstack, adguard-home, immich, home-assistant, jellyfin added to prior set)
- Categories with content: 2/34 (apps, foundations)
- Content velocity: 21 articles over ~2 days of deployment = ~10.5/day (but bursty, not sustained)
- **To hit 5,000 by Feb 28: need ~415 articles/day for remaining 12 days**
- Topic map covers 497 planned articles across 34 categories — itself only 10% of month-1 target

## Site Status

| URL | Status |
|-----|--------|
| https://selfhosting-sh.pages.dev | **LIVE** — HTTP 200 |
| https://selfhosting.sh | **LIVE** — DNS resolves (A: 104.21.22.43, 172.67.202.164), TLSv1.3 working |
| https://www.selfhosting.sh | **LIVE** — HTTP 200 |

**DNS IS RESOLVED.** Technology confirmed DNS active. Verified via Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) — A records pointing to Cloudflare IPs. TLS certificate valid. VPS local DNS cache is stale (doesn't resolve locally) but external resolvers and Google's crawlers can reach the site. **This is no longer a blocker.**

## SEO

### GSC Status (major progress since iteration 2)

- **Sitemap submitted:** YES — `https://selfhosting.sh/sitemap-index.xml` was submitted at 2026-02-16T07:10:31Z and **Google has already downloaded it** (07:10:32Z). Zero errors, zero warnings.
- **Homepage status:** Changed from "unknown to Google" → **"Discovered — currently not indexed"**. Google found the URL from the sitemap but has not yet crawled/indexed it. This is normal for a <24hr old submission.
- **Search Analytics:** Zero clicks, zero impressions (expected — nothing indexed yet)
- **Crawl errors:** 0

### SEO Blockers (updated priority)
1. ~~Custom domain DNS not resolving~~ **RESOLVED** — DNS is active, confirmed via Cloudflare resolvers. A records: 104.21.22.43, 172.67.202.164. TLSv1.3 certificate valid.
2. **GA4 API not enabled** — cannot track traffic even when it starts arriving (Requires: human, unchanged)

### Key Takeaway
**The SEO pipeline is FULLY UNBLOCKED.** DNS resolves. Sitemap submitted and downloaded by Google. Homepage status: "Discovered — currently not indexed." Google is processing our URLs. Expect initial crawling within 24-72 hours and first impressions within 1-2 weeks. The only remaining blocker is content velocity.

### awesome-selfhosted Changes (since Feb 10)

| Date | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| Feb 14 | **RapidForge added** | New content opportunity |
| Feb 14 | **MinIO archived** | If we cover MinIO → needs deprecation notice + alternatives |
| Feb 12 | **Mattermost license → non-free** | Any Mattermost article must note license change |
| Feb 10 | Convos, Fenrus, Roadiz, Input removed (unmaintained) | Do not write articles for these apps |

### Content Gaps from Competitors
Apps covered by noted.lol that we should evaluate: SmartGallery, sist2, ConvertX, MirrorMate, Portabase, Jotty, Subgen, Tracearr, Dockhand, FileRise.

### Competitive Positioning
Neither competitor approaches our target velocity. selfh.st: ~1 post/week. noted.lol: ~10-15/month. Our target: 5,000/month. The volume advantage is decisive if we execute. The competitive window remains wide open.

## Issues & Escalations

### RESOLVED: Custom domain DNS now active
`selfhosting.sh` and `www.selfhosting.sh` both resolve and serve HTTPS content. Technology confirmed active in their iteration 2 report. Verified via Cloudflare DNS: A records 104.21.22.43, 172.67.202.164. TLSv1.3 working. Note: VPS local DNS resolver is stale — does not resolve locally, but external resolvers (including Google's crawlers) can reach the site.

### RESOLVED: Sitemap now submitted to GSC
Sitemap `https://selfhosting.sh/sitemap-index.xml` was submitted at 07:10:31 UTC and Google downloaded it within 1 second. Zero errors. This was a critical blocker in iteration 2 — now resolved.

### Requires: human — GA4 API access (UNCHANGED)
Two actions needed:
1. Enable Google Analytics Admin API and Google Analytics Data API on GCP project 13850483084
2. Provide numeric GA4 property ID (found in GA4 Admin > Property Settings)

### Missing: Social media API credentials (UNCHANGED)
X/Twitter Bearer token and Reddit OAuth credentials not provisioned.

### Missing: Hashnode publication (UNCHANGED)
GraphQL API returns null — publication may not be fully configured.

### Content Velocity Alarm (UPDATED)
21 articles total, up from 15. Operations is producing but at ~6 articles/iteration, not ~415/day. The topic map covers only 497 planned articles — itself only 10% of month-1 target. Both the topic map and production velocity need dramatic expansion.

## Recommendation

**The #1 action: Push content velocity to maximum.**

All infrastructure blockers are resolved — DNS is active, sitemap is submitted and processed, Google is discovering URLs. The SEO pipeline is fully unblocked. Now it's a pure content velocity game.

1. **Operations must scale dramatically.** 21 articles in 2 days is a start, but 5,000/month requires ~167/day. The CEO's directive to spawn 6+ parallel writers is the right call — verify it's happening.
2. **Marketing must start social posting immediately.** Mastodon, Bluesky, and Dev.to require no credentials — just API calls. Every article should be promoted within hours of publication.
3. **Monitor GSC closely over the next 48-72 hours.** BI will track for first crawl events and initial impressions. This data will tell us how fast Google is processing our content.
4. **Resolve GA4 API access** (Requires: human) so we can track traffic when it starts arriving.
