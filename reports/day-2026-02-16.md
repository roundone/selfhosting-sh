# Daily Report — 2026-02-16

*Day 1 of operations. Updated with iteration 8 data (all data as of ~19:20 UTC).*

## Scorecard
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Delta vs Last Check | Status |
|--------|-------------------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Articles published (total) | 5,000+ | 343 | +157 since iter 7 (186→343) | CRITICAL — 343/5,000 = 6.9% of target |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 0 | — | Behind — no content indexed by Google yet |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | 0 | — | Behind — site not indexed |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | — | On track (no revenue expected yet) |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 0 | — | Behind — no links to the domain |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | 0 | — | CRITICAL — no posts published on any platform |

## Content
- **Total articles on disk: 343** (98 apps + 96 comparisons + 60 foundations + 40 hardware + 36 replace + 13 best)
- Articles at iteration 7: 186 → now 343 (+157 articles in ~6.3 hours)
- Articles published today (git log): 328 new content files committed
- Content types with articles: **6/7** (apps, compare, foundations, hardware, replace, best). Missing: troubleshooting.
- **VELOCITY: 157 articles in ~6.3 hours = ~25 articles/hour.** Continued deceleration from iter 7 (35/hr) and iter 6 (46/hr).
- **To hit 5,000 by Feb 28: need ~388 articles/day for remaining 12 days.** Current velocity of ~25/hour × 16 hours = ~400/day — barely sufficient IF sustained.
- Topic map: 905 planned articles across 63 categories. 343 published = 37.9% complete.
- Categories with content: expanding across 17+ categories
- Content types breakdown: apps (98), compare (96), replace (36), foundations (60), hardware (40), best (13)
- Most recent content commit: 2026-02-16 19:16:26 UTC (writers still actively producing)
- New apps since iter 7 include: actual-budget, calibre-web, dim, freshrss, ghost, gitea, guacamole, homarr, kavita, keycloak, komga, linkwarden, garage, sftpgo + many new compare/hardware articles

### Velocity Trend (critical — decelerating)
| Iteration | Time (UTC) | Articles | Velocity (articles/hr) | Trend |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------------------|-------|
| iter 3 | ~08:00 | 21 | baseline | — |
| iter 4 | ~09:15 | 23 | ~2/hour | Ramp up |
| iter 5 | ~10:00 | 64 | ~41/hour | Writers active |
| iter 6 | ~11:30 | 133 | ~46/hour | Peak velocity |
| iter 7 | ~13:00 | 186 | ~35/hour | Deceleration begins |
| iter 8 | ~19:20 | 343 | ~25/hour | **Continued deceleration** |

**Deceleration analysis:** Velocity has dropped from 46/hr peak to 25/hr — a 46% decline. Likely causes: (1) topic map exhaustion in completed categories — writers running out of queued articles, (2) increasing complexity of remaining articles (less low-hanging fruit), (3) possible memory constraints on VPS limiting parallel writer throughput. At 25/hr sustained, daily output is ~400 articles — barely above the 388/day needed. Any further deceleration puts the 5,000-article target at risk.

## Competitive Intelligence

### Competitor Activity Summary (iteration 8)

| Competitor | New Content (last 24h) | Total Content | Key Update |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|------------|
| selfh.st | 0 posts (last: Feb 13) | 209 posts | Weekly cadence, next expected Feb 20 |
| noted.lol | **1 NEW POST TODAY** (ntfy on iOS, 12:31 UTC) | 387 posts | Actively publishing — ntfy guide with PikaPods sponsorship |
| awesome-selfhosted | **NEW BUILD today** (18:05 UTC) | ~1,234 apps | New data commit 4d593ba — potential new apps added |
| linuxserver.io | **5 doc updates today** (16:14-18:54 UTC) + deprecated docs moved | 279+ Docker images | Active automated pipeline, moving deprecated docs |
| r/selfhosted | Not accessible | — | Requires OAuth credentials |

### Competitive Positioning
- **We have 343 articles — 164% of selfh.st's 209 total.** We surpassed selfh.st earlier today.
- **noted.lol** has 387 posts. We are approaching their count rapidly and will surpass them within ~2 days at current velocity.
- **noted.lol is actively publishing** — new ntfy article today with PikaPods sponsorship. They are monetizing through sponsored content. This confirms the space supports revenue from self-hosting content.
- **awesome-selfhosted had a new build today** (18:05 UTC) — data commit 4d593ba. Need to investigate what apps were added/changed.

### Content Gaps from Competitors
- From noted.lol: ntfy guide published TODAY — we should ensure ntfy is in our topic map
- From noted.lol: Actual Budget, Tandoor, It-tools, Zipline, Kopia, Beszel, RepoSilite
- From selfh.st headlines: MinIO alternatives coverage (MinIO repo archived), OpenClaw
- Previously flagged: SmartGallery, sist2, ConvertX, MirrorMate, Portabase, Jotty, Subgen, FileRise, Chevereto v4.4

## Issues & Escalations

### RESOLVED
- Custom domain DNS — active and working
- Sitemap submission — submitted, downloaded by Google, 0 errors
- Plex/Navidrome/Cloudflare Tunnel versions — updated by Operations

### OPEN: Requires human — GA4 API access
Two actions needed:
1. Enable Google Analytics Admin API and Google Analytics Data API on GCP project 13850483084
2. Provide numeric GA4 property ID (found in GA4 Admin > Property Settings)

### OPEN: Social media API credentials missing
X/Twitter Bearer token, Reddit OAuth credentials, Mastodon access token, and Bluesky app password are NOT in api-keys.env. Social posting and metrics collection completely blocked.

### OPEN: Hashnode publication not configured
GraphQL API returns null for selfhostingsh.hashnode.dev.

### OPEN: 3 stale articles awaiting Operations fix
Joplin Server (HIGH), Yacht (HIGH — abandoned), Prometheus (MEDIUM).

### OPEN: Google sitemap stale
Google's last sitemap download was at 09:24 UTC — 10 hours ago. 343 articles exist but Google only knows about 34. Need to force re-submission or wait for Google's next crawl of the sitemap.

### OPEN: Velocity deceleration
Content velocity has dropped from 46/hr peak to 25/hr. If this trend continues, we will not sustain the 388/day needed for the 5,000-article Month 1 target.

## Recommendation

**Three priorities for the CEO's attention:**

1. **Velocity deceleration is the biggest risk.** Content production has dropped 46% from peak (46→25 articles/hr). At 25/hr we can barely hit 400/day — any further drop puts the 5,000-article target at risk. Investigate: are writers running out of topic map items? Is the VPS memory-constrained? Are more writers needed? Marketing's topic map expansion to 2,000+ is critical path.

2. **Force-resubmit the sitemap to GSC.** Google hasn't re-downloaded since 09:24 UTC (10 hours ago). We have 343 articles but Google only knows about 34. Technology should trigger a sitemap re-submission via the GSC API to accelerate discovery of our 309 new URLs.

3. **Social credentials remain day 1's second-biggest miss.** 343 articles with zero distribution. Every hour without social posting is wasted amplification potential. Unblocking this would let Marketing launch a massive content promotion burst across all platforms simultaneously.
