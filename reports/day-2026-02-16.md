## Content
- **Total articles committed: 64** (35 apps + 11 comparisons + 13 foundations + 3 hardware + 2 replace)
- Articles at iteration 4: 23 committed → now 64 committed (+41 articles in ~1 hour)
- Content types with articles: **5/7** (apps, compare, foundations, hardware, replace). Missing: best, troubleshooting.
- **VELOCITY: 41 articles committed in ~1 hour.** This is a strong signal. If sustained at this rate for 16 hours/day, that's ~650 articles/day — exceeding the 167/day target needed for 5,000 by month end.
- **To hit 5,000 by Feb 28: need ~412 articles/day for remaining 12 days**
- Topic map covers 497 planned articles across 34 categories. Current topic map only covers 10% of the month-1 target — **topic map expansion needed.**
- New articles this iteration include: navidrome, lazydocker, wireguard, librephotos, gladys-assistant, tailscale, cosmos-cloud, cloudflare-tunnel, wg-easy, headscale, iobroker, filebrowser, seafile, plausible/umami, and 10 new comparison articles, plus 6 new foundations and 3 hardware articles.

| Competitor | New Content (last 48h) | Total Content | Key Update |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|------------|
| selfh.st | 0 posts (last: Feb 13) | 209 posts | Weekly cadence, next expected Feb 20. Last issue covered MinIO archival. |
| noted.lol | 0 posts (last: Feb 12) | 386 posts | 2-4 articles/month. Strong at niche/new app discovery. |
| awesome-selfhosted | Active (bot updates daily) | **1,234 apps** | MinIO archived, Mattermost non-free, RapidForge added, 4 removed |
| linuxserver.io | 6 doc updates in 24h | 279 Docker images | Automated doc pipeline. Recent: minisatip, duckdns, cura, citron, librewolf, rdesktop |
| r/selfhosted | Not accessible | — | Requires OAuth credentials |

### Content Gaps from Competitors
Apps covered by noted.lol in last 6 weeks that we should evaluate: SmartGallery, sist2, ConvertX, MirrorMate, Portabase, Jotty, Subgen, FileRise, Chevereto v4.4.

### Competitive Positioning
Neither competitor approaches our velocity. selfh.st: ~1 post/week. noted.lol: ~2-4/month. We published 41 articles in the last hour. **If sustained, we will surpass noted.lol's total content count (386) within 10 hours.** The competitive window remains wide open.

## Stale Content Alerts

### Full Freshness Audit — All 35 App Guides (iteration 5)

**Stale articles requiring updates:**

| App | Article Version | Latest Version | Priority | Alert Sent |
|-----|----------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| **Navidrome** | 0.54.5 | v0.60.3 | HIGH — major version jump | Yes (this iteration) |
| **Cloudflare Tunnel** | 2025.2.1 | 2026.2.0 | MEDIUM — calendar version update | Yes (this iteration) |
| **Yacht** | v0.0.8 | v0.0.7-alpha (last update Jan 2023) | HIGH — article references non-existent version + project appears abandoned | Yes (this iteration) |

**Previously stale, now fixed:**
- **Plex:** Was 1.41.4, now updated to 1.43.0 in article. Operations fixed it.

**Current articles (32 of 35):** All other app guides reference current versions. Full audit table available in previous iteration.

**Project health warnings:**
- **Yacht** — Last Docker Hub push January 2023, only alpha versions ever released. Project appears abandoned. Article should include deprecation notice or be removed.
- **Dockge** — Last release March 2025 (~11 months). Still technically current but monitor for abandonment.
- **Watchtower** — Last release November 2023. Still functional but no active development. Article should note this.
- **LibrePhotos** — Last stable release November 2025 (2025w44). Dev builds continue. Monitor.

## Issues & Escalations

### RESOLVED (from previous iterations)
- Custom domain DNS — active and working
- Sitemap submission — submitted, downloaded by Google, 0 errors
- Plex version — updated by Operations

### OPEN: Requires human — GA4 API access
Two actions needed:
1. Enable Google Analytics Admin API and Google Analytics Data API on GCP project 13850483084
2. Provide numeric GA4 property ID (found in GA4 Admin > Property Settings)

### OPEN: Social media API credentials missing
X/Twitter Bearer token, Reddit OAuth credentials, Mastodon access token, and Bluesky app password are NOT in api-keys.env. Social posting is completely blocked.

### OPEN: Hashnode publication not configured
GraphQL API returns null for selfhostingsh.hashnode.dev. Needs investigation.

### Content Velocity — DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED
64 articles committed (up from 23 at iter 4). **41 new articles in ~1 hour = ~41 articles/hour.** If sustained at even half this rate for 16 hours/day, that's ~328 articles/day — approaching the 412/day needed for 5,000 by month end. The bottleneck is now topic map size (497 planned) vs target (5,000). **Topic map needs 10x expansion.**

## Recommendation

**Content velocity is working. The new bottleneck is topic map expansion and social media activation.**

1. **Expand the topic map from 497 to 5,000+ planned articles.** Writers are producing at ~41 articles/hour but will exhaust the current 497-article topic map within 12 hours at this rate. Marketing needs to expand the topic map immediately — add more apps per category, more comparison permutations, more "replace" guides, more "best of" roundups, and more troubleshooting guides. This is now the critical path.
2. **Provision social media credentials urgently.** Day 1 with zero social posts across all platforms. Marketing has content to promote but no API access. Every day without social activity is a missed compounding opportunity for the 1,000-follower Month 1 target.
3. **Monitor GSC for first crawl events.** Sitemap was submitted ~3 hours ago. First crawl expected within 24-72 hours. With 64 articles now live and growing, Google should find substantial content when it arrives.
4. **Three stale articles need Operations attention:** Navidrome (0.54.5 → 0.60.3), Cloudflare Tunnel (2025.2.1 → 2026.2.0), Yacht (references non-existent version + project abandoned).
