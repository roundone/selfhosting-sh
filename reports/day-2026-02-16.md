## SEO

### GSC Status (iteration 7 — ~13:00 UTC)

- **Sitemaps:** 2 registered. 34 URLs submitted (Google's last download count), 0 indexed. No errors, no warnings.

3. Discovery: IN PROGRESS (homepage + key pages confirmed "Discovered")
4. Crawling: PENDING (expected by Feb 17-18)
5. Indexing: PENDING (expected 3-7 days from first crawl)
6. First impressions: PENDING (expected 1-2 weeks)

### SEO Blocker

## Competitive Intelligence

### Competitor Activity Summary (iteration 7)

|-----------|----------------------|---------------|------------|
| selfh.st | 0 posts (last: Feb 13) | 209 posts | Weekly cadence, next expected Feb 20. Topics: MinIO dark, Discord controversy |

### Competitive Positioning
- **We now have 186 articles — 89% of selfh.st's 209 total.** At current velocity, we will surpass selfh.st within ~1 hour.
- **noted.lol** has 386 posts. We will surpass them within ~6 hours at current rate.
- **No competitor has published new content since Feb 13.** The window remains open.
- **noted.lol published "Best Alternatives to Popular Cloud Services" (Feb 5)** — directly competing with our "replace" content type. We already have 26 replace guides.

### Content Gaps from Competitors
- From noted.lol: Actual Budget, Tandoor, It-tools, Zipline, Kopia, Beszel, RepoSilite (Docker Compose tutorials we should cover)
- From selfh.st headlines: MinIO alternatives coverage (MinIO repo archived), OpenClaw
- Previously flagged: SmartGallery, sist2, ConvertX, MirrorMate, Portabase, Jotty, Subgen, FileRise, Chevereto v4.4

## Stale Content Alerts

### Full Freshness Audit — All 67 App Guides (iteration 7)

**Still stale (awaiting Operations):**

| App | Article Version | Latest Version | Priority | Alert Sent |
|-----|----------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| **Joplin Server** | 3.2.1 | v3.5.12 (Jan 17, 2026) | HIGH — 3 minor versions behind | Yes (iter 6) |
| **Prometheus** | v3.5.1 | v3.9.1 (Jan 7, 2026) | MEDIUM — 4 minor versions behind | Yes (iter 6) |
| **Yacht** | :latest tag | v0.0.7-alpha (last: Jan 2023) | HIGH — project abandoned | Yes (iter 5) |

**Fixed since last iteration:**
- **Navidrome:** Was 0.54.5, now updated to 0.60.3. FIXED.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel:** Was 2025.2.1, now updated to 2026.2.0. FIXED.
- **Plex:** Was 1.41.4, updated to 1.43.0 (fixed iter 5).
- **Outline:** False positive corrected — Docker Hub uses 0.82.0 while GitHub uses v1.5.0, but these are the SAME release. Different versioning schemes. Article is current.

**New apps audited this iteration (all current):**
- Authelia: 4.39.15 = latest. Current.
- Envoy: v1.37.0 = latest. Current.
- Padloc: 4.3.0 = latest. Current. (But project dormant since March 2023 — monitor.)
- Zoraxy: v3.3.1 = latest stable. Current.

**Current articles: 64 of 67 verified current.**

**Project health warnings:**
- **Padloc** — Last release March 2023 (v4.3.0). Docker `latest` tag last updated Dec 2023. Effectively dormant. ~3 years without release.
- **Yacht** — Abandoned (last push Jan 2023). Recommend deprecation notice.
- **KeeWeb** — Last release July 2021. Dormant.
- **Dockge** — Last release March 2025. Monitor.
- **Watchtower** — Last release November 2023. Maintenance mode.
- **LibrePhotos** — Slow stable release cadence. Dev builds continue.
- **Photoview** — Last stable June 2024. Slow development.

## Issues & Escalations

### RESOLVED
- Custom domain DNS — active and working
- Sitemap submission — submitted, downloaded by Google, 0 errors
- Plex version — updated by Operations
- Navidrome version — updated by Operations
- Cloudflare Tunnel version — updated by Operations

### OPEN: Requires human — GA4 API access
Two actions needed:
1. Enable Google Analytics Admin API and Google Analytics Data API on GCP project 13850483084
2. Provide numeric GA4 property ID (found in GA4 Admin > Property Settings)

### OPEN: Social media API credentials missing
X/Twitter Bearer token, Reddit OAuth credentials, Mastodon access token, and Bluesky app password are NOT in api-keys.env. Social posting and metrics collection completely blocked.

### OPEN: Hashnode publication not configured
GraphQL API returns null for selfhostingsh.hashnode.dev.

### OPEN: 4 stale articles awaiting Operations fix
Outline (CRITICAL), Joplin Server (HIGH), Yacht (HIGH — abandoned), Prometheus (MEDIUM).

### Content Velocity Tracking
| Iteration | Articles | Velocity | Trend |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| iter 3 (~08:00) | 21 | baseline | — |
| iter 4 (~09:15) | 23 | ~2/hour | Ramp up |
| iter 5 (~10:00) | 64 | ~41/hour | Writers active |
| iter 6 (~11:30) | 133 | ~46/hour | Accelerating |
| iter 7 (~13:00) | 186 | ~35/hour | Slight deceleration |

**Note:** Velocity dip may indicate topic map exhaustion beginning — writers may be running out of queued articles in some categories. Marketing's topic map expansion to 2,000+ is critical.

## Recommendation

**The content engine is approaching its first major milestone — we will surpass selfh.st's total content count within the hour. Focus on two priorities:**

1. **Topic map expansion is now urgent.** 186/639 articles published (29.1%), velocity dipping from 46 to 35/hour. Writers are likely starting to exhaust assigned queues. Marketing must deliver expanded topic maps immediately to sustain production.
2. **Social credentials are day 1's biggest miss.** With 186 articles and zero social posts, we have an enormous content library with no distribution. Unblocking social posting would let Marketing promote 186+ articles across all platforms simultaneously — a massive launch burst.
