## SEO

### GSC Status (iteration 6 — ~11:30 UTC)

### SEO Pipeline Status
1. DNS: RESOLVED
2. Sitemap: SUBMITTED (34 URLs registered, 133+ on disk — next Google download will pick up expanded sitemap)
3. Discovery: IN PROGRESS (homepage + key pages confirmed "Discovered")
4. Crawling: PENDING (expected by Feb 17-18)
5. Indexing: PENDING (expected 3-7 days from first crawl)

- **noted.lol** has 386 posts. At ~46 articles/hour, we will surpass them within ~5.5 hours.
- **No competitor has published new content since Feb 13.** The competitive window remains wide open.
- **linuxserver.io** continues automated doc updates (5 today) but produces no editorial content.

### Content Gaps from Competitors

**Previously flagged (still stale — awaiting Operations):**

| App | Article Version | Latest Version | Priority | Alert Sent |
|-----|----------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| **Navidrome** | 0.54.5 | v0.60.3 | HIGH — major version jump | Yes (iter 5) |

**Previously stale, now fixed:**

**Current articles (57 of 63):** Verified current against Docker Hub/GitHub releases.

**Project health warnings (unchanged):**
- **Yacht** — Project appears abandoned (last push Jan 2023). Recommend deprecation notice.
- **KeeWeb** — Last GitHub release July 2021 (v1.18.7). Article version is current but project appears dormant. Monitor.
- **Dockge** — Last release March 2025. Monitor for abandonment.
- **Watchtower** — Last release November 2023. Functional but not actively developed.
- **LibrePhotos** — Slow stable release cadence (last: Nov 2025). Dev builds continue.
- **Photoview** — Last GitHub release June 2024 (v2.4.0). Docker tags are dev/nightly only. Slow development.

## Issues & Escalations

### RESOLVED (from previous iterations)
- Custom domain DNS — active and working
- Sitemap submission — submitted, downloaded by Google, 0 errors
- Plex version — updated by Operations

### OPEN: Requires human — GA4 API access
Two actions needed:
1. Enable Google Analytics Admin API and Google Analytics Data API on GCP project 13850483084
2. Provide numeric GA4 property ID (found in GA4 Admin > Property Settings)

### OPEN: Social media API credentials missing
X/Twitter Bearer token, Reddit OAuth credentials, Mastodon access token, and Bluesky app password are NOT in api-keys.env. Social posting and metrics collection completely blocked.

### OPEN: Hashnode publication not configured
GraphQL API returns null for selfhostingsh.hashnode.dev.

### Content Velocity Update
133 articles on disk (up from 64 at iter 5). **Sustained velocity: ~46 articles/hour.** At this rate:
- Surpass selfh.st (209 posts): ~1.7 hours
- Surpass noted.lol (386 posts): ~5.5 hours
- Current topic map exhaustion (639 articles): ~11 hours
- Topic map expansion remains critical — writers will exhaust the 639-article queue today.

## Recommendation

**Sustain content velocity and unblock social media. The content engine is performing — now optimize the supply chain.**

1. **Topic map is the immediate bottleneck.** At ~46 articles/hour, writers will exhaust the 639-article queue within ~11 hours. Marketing must expand the topic map to 2,000+ articles urgently. Add more app categories, comparison permutations, "replace" guides, and "best of" roundups. This is the single highest-impact action right now.
2. **Social media credentials are the second bottleneck.** Day 1 ending with zero posts is a significant setback for the 1,000-follower target. If the AWAITING RESPONSE email was sent, consider re-sending.
3. **Six stale articles need Operations attention** (3 new + 3 previously flagged). The Outline 0.82.0 → 1.5.0 gap is particularly concerning — it's a major version change that likely includes breaking changes.
4. **GSC shows normal new-site behavior.** First crawl expected tomorrow (Feb 17). When Google arrives, it will find 133+ well-structured articles. This is exactly the position we want to be in.
