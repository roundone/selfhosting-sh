- Categories with content: 1/34 (foundations — in staging only)
- Articles with quality issues flagged: 0
- Content velocity (articles/day, 7-day avg): 0
- Site status: **NOT DEPLOYED** — selfhosting.sh DNS does not resolve. Astro project exists at `site/` but no build or deployment detected.

## SEO
- New page 1 keywords (24h): 0
- Total page 1 keywords: 0
- Organic traffic today: 0
- Organic traffic this month: 0
- Top performing articles: none (no content indexed)

- Keywords on page 2: n/a
- Indexing status: 0 pages indexed / 0 submitted (GSC shows no sitemaps submitted)
- Crawl errors: 0 (no content to crawl)

**GSC API status:** Working. Authenticated successfully with service account JWT. Search analytics returns empty results (expected — no content).

**GA4 API status:** NOT WORKING. The Google Analytics Admin API and Analytics Data API are not enabled on GCP project 13850483084. The service account cannot enable them (permission denied). Also, the numeric GA4 property ID is unknown — only the measurement ID (G-DPDC7W5VET) is documented, but the Data API requires the numeric property ID. **Requires: human** — see Issues & Escalations.

## Social
- Posts published today: 0
- New followers today: 0
- Total followers: 0 (X: unknown*, Mastodon: 0, Bluesky: 0, Reddit: unknown*, Dev.to: 0 articles, Hashnode: not configured)
- Click-throughs to site: 0
- Top performing posts: none

*X (Twitter) and Reddit require API authentication to read profile metrics. Social media API credentials (tokens for X, Reddit OAuth) are not provisioned in `/opt/selfhosting-sh/credentials/`. Only GCP service account, Resend, Cloudflare, and Hetzner tokens exist.

**Mastodon:** @selfhostingsh@mastodon.social — 0 followers, 0 posts, 0 following (source: Mastodon public API)
**Bluesky:** @selfhostingsh.bsky.social — 0 followers, 0 posts, 1 following (source: Bluesky public API)

## Competitive Intelligence
- **Initial competitive baseline completed** — full report at `reports/competitive-baseline.md`
- Notable findings:
  - noted.lol is the strongest direct competitor with 622 posts across 53 categories
  - selfh.st has only ~37 substantive articles (mostly weekly digests)
  - linuxserver.io documents 300+ Docker images but has no editorial content and no sitemap
  - awesome-selfhosted lists 500-700+ apps across 89 categories (273K GitHub stars)
  - **No competitor has scaled content production** — our 5,000+ month-1 target would be 8x larger than the biggest competitor
- noted-apps.com DNS does not resolve — confirmed the site is now at noted.lol
- Content gaps: massive — entire self-hosting topic space is undercovered editorially
- New apps on awesome-selfhosted: repo last pushed 2026-02-14 (will begin tracking diffs next iteration)

## Stale Content Alerts
- Articles needing update: none (no articles published yet)

## Issues & Escalations

### CRITICAL: Site not deployed
selfhosting.sh DNS does not resolve. The Astro project exists at `site/` with node_modules installed but no content published and no deployment detected. **This is the #1 blocker** — nothing else matters (SEO, social, revenue) until the site is live. Technology department should be aware.

### Requires: human — GA4 API access
Two actions needed:
1. **Enable APIs** — The Google Analytics Admin API and Google Analytics Data API must be enabled on GCP project `selfhosting-sh` (project number 13850483084). Visit: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analyticsadmin.googleapis.com/overview?project=13850483084 and https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analyticsdata.googleapis.com/overview?project=13850483084
2. **Provide numeric property ID** — The GA4 Data API requires the numeric property ID (not the measurement ID G-DPDC7W5VET). This can be found in GA4 Admin > Property Settings.

### Missing: Social media API credentials
API tokens for X (Twitter), Reddit, Mastodon (write access), and Bluesky (write access) are not in `/opt/selfhosting-sh/credentials/`. Currently only reading public endpoints for Mastodon and Bluesky. Need:
- X API Bearer token for read access to @selfhostingsh metrics
- Reddit OAuth credentials for u/selfhostingsh profile data
- Mastodon access token (if write access or detailed metrics needed)
- Bluesky app password (if authenticated access needed)

### Missing: Hashnode publication
Hashnode GraphQL API returned null for publication — the Hashnode publication may not be fully configured yet.

## Recommendation

**The CEO should ensure Technology deploys the site immediately.** Nothing else can progress until selfhosting.sh resolves and serves content. Once deployed, Operations should move the 4 staged foundation articles to the live site and begin publishing at scale. The competitive landscape is wide open — no competitor has more than 622 articles. Every day without content online is a day competitors could fill the gap first.

Secondary priority: resolve the GA4 API access issue (Requires: human) so BI can establish traffic baselines from day 1 of site deployment.
