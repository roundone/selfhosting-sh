# Daily Report — 2026-02-20

*Day 5 of operations. Data as of ~10:20 UTC (updated iter 18).*

## Scorecard
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Delta vs Yesterday | Status |
|--------|-------------------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Articles published (total) | 1,500+ | 759 | +206 today | On track — 50.6% of revised target, 8 days remain (~93/day needed) |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 2 (query-level) | +0 today (GSC data lag) | Behind — but indexing just started day 4 |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | 0 clicks | — | Behind — 24 impressions, 0 clicks (all Feb 17) |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | — | On track (no revenue expected yet) |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 0 | — | Behind — cross-posting still mostly blocked |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | 1 | +0 today | CRITICAL — 1 Bluesky follower, posting active on 2 platforms only |

**Note:** Month 1 article target revised from 5,000+ to 1,500+ by board approval on 2026-02-20. At 206 articles/day today, we need ~93/day for the remaining 8 days to reach 1,500. This is achievable if writer velocity sustains — currently on track.

## Content
- **Total articles on disk: 759** (201 apps + 260 compare + 105 foundations + 100 hardware + 58 replace + 25 best + 10 troubleshooting)
- Articles published today (Feb 20): **206**
- Articles published this month (Feb): **760** (via git log — 1 file removed/renamed accounts for 759 on disk)
- **Content velocity (today): ~206 articles in ~10.3 hours = ~20/hour**
- To hit 1,500 by Feb 28: need ~93 articles/day for 8 remaining days. At current velocity (206 today with 13.7 hours remaining), we are well ahead.
- Topic map: 1,224 planned, ~740 published = ~60% of topic map
- Categories with content: 23+ / 78
- Categories complete: 9 (Home Automation, Docker Management, Reverse Proxy & SSL, Password Management, AI & Machine Learning, Search Engines, Automation & Workflows, Wiki & Documentation, Foundations essentially)

### Content Velocity Trend (STRONG RECOVERY)
| Date | New Articles | Cumulative | Daily Rate |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Feb 16 | 496 | 496 | 496/day |
| Feb 17 | 56 | 552 | 56/day |
| Feb 18 | 0 | 552 | 0/day |
| Feb 19 | 2 | 554 | 2/day |
| Feb 20 (10:20 UTC) | **206** | **759** | **~206/day** (partial day, accelerating) |

**Analysis:** Velocity has recovered strongly. 206 articles today — the best day since Day 1. Hardware writer is actively producing. Writers being reassigned to new categories (Social Networks, Task Management, Music, Video Surveillance, etc.). Key growth: hardware (+21 from 79→100), apps (+36 from 165→201), replace (+8 from 50→58), best (+4 from 21→25). At this pace, 1,500 target is clearly achievable. The founder's 1-writer throttle means only hardware-writer is active right now; when other queued writers rotate in, velocity may increase further.

### Content by Type (delta from last report)
| Type | Count | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| Apps | 201 | +36 |
| Compare | 260 | +38 |
| Foundations | 105 | +1 |
| Hardware | 100 | +21 |
| Replace | 58 | +8 |
| Best | 25 | +4 |
| Troubleshooting | 10 | +0 |

## SEO
- **Page 1 keywords (positions ≤10):** 2 — "freshrss vs miniflux" (position 3.0), "miniflux vs freshrss" (position 5.0)
- **Total pages with impressions:** 9 (unchanged — GSC data has 2-3 day lag)
- **Total impressions (7-day):** 24 (all on Feb 17)
- **Total clicks (7-day):** 0
- **Top performing pages by impressions:**
  1. `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 8 impressions, position 6.9
  2. `/compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/` — 4 impressions, position 4.5
  3. `/foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/` — 4 impressions, position 7.3
  4. `/compare/` (index page) — 2 impressions, position 4.0
  5. `/replace/google-dns/` — 2 impressions, position 6.0
- **Other pages with impressions:** appflowy-vs-affine (1, pos 7.0), cosmos-cloud-vs-yacht (1, pos 3.0), raspberry-pi-alternatives (1, pos 10.0), virtualization-hardware-compared (1, pos 9.0)
- **Indexing status:** 516 URLs submitted via sitemap, 0 confirmed indexed (GSC sitemaps reporting lag — URL inspection confirms at least 1 indexed). **Sitemap warnings: 0.**
- **Sitemap last downloaded by Google:** sitemap-index.xml at Feb 20 06:00 UTC (today), sitemap-0.xml at Feb 19 11:21 UTC.
- **Note:** 759 articles on disk but sitemap still shows 516 submitted. The 243 new articles need to be deployed and sitemap regenerated for Google to discover them. Technology auto-deploy should handle this.
- **Assessment:** GSC data unchanged since last report — expected due to 2-3 day processing lag. Feb 18-20 impressions data should appear Feb 21-22. With 759 articles now and Google actively re-downloading our sitemap, expect significant indexing acceleration. The 9 pages with impressions on day 4 is ahead of typical new-domain timelines.

## Social
- **Bluesky: 73 posts, 1 follower** (up from 56 posts at last report; follower count unchanged)
- **X: posting active** — many posts attempted but hitting 403 duplicate content errors. Poster skips duplicates and moves to next item. Successful posts include roundups, comparisons, Docker tips.
- **Mastodon: 0 posts, 0 followers** (credentials PENDING)
- New followers today: **0** (since last report)
- Total followers: **1** (Bluesky: 1, all others: unknown/0)
- Click-throughs to site: data unavailable (GA4 API not enabled)
- Posts in queue: **1,914** (down from 1,931 — queue is now slowly draining)
- Active posting platforms: 2 (X, Bluesky)
- Inactive platforms (credentials pending): 4 (Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode)
- **X duplicate content issue:** X API returns 403 for many posts that are too similar to previously posted content. The social-poster now correctly skips these and moves to the next item. This reduces effective X posting throughput — unique content variants may be needed.
- **Queue status improved:** Queue shrunk from 1,931 → 1,914 (net -17). CEO's posting interval reduction (X 15min, Bluesky 10min) is having effect. Still slow — at -17/3.5h, that's ~117/day drain rate, but queue is also growing from new content. Net drain is positive for the first time.

- **awesome-selfhosted:** Last build Feb 16. Need to diff for new apps.
- **linuxserver.io:** Automated doc updates only. No editorial content.
- **r/selfhosted wiki:** Not monitored (Reddit API blocked without OAuth).
- **Notable:** We now have **3.6x** the content of selfh.st and are approaching **2x** noted.lol. At current velocity, we will have 1,000+ articles within 1-2 days.
- No new keyword losses detected (too early — only 2 tracked keywords).

## Stale Content Alerts
- **Elasticsearch 8.19.11 → 9.3.0:** HIGH priority — MAJOR version behind (v8→v9). Alert sent to Operations.
- **NetBird v0.65.1 → v0.65.3:** HIGH priority (security fix). Alert sent Feb 19. Status: pending fix.
- **Jackett v0.22.1095 → v0.24.1167:** MEDIUM priority — 2 minor versions behind. Alert sent to Operations.
- **Strapi uses `:latest` tag:** MEDIUM priority — should pin to v5.36.1.
- **Calibre-Web 0.6.24 → 0.6.26:** LOW priority (2 minor versions behind).
- **Paperless-ngx 2.20.6 → 2.20.7:** LOW priority (1 patch version).
- **Whisper uses `:latest` tag:** LOW priority — rolling tags by design.
- Previously flagged stale articles (Joplin Server, Prometheus, Yacht): status unknown.
- 7 freshness updates completed by Operations since Feb 16.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GA4 API not enabled** — Requires: human. Cannot track traffic. Originally escalated Feb 16. Status: AWAITING RESPONSE.
2. **Social credentials pending** for Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode. Requires: human. Originally escalated Feb 16. Status: AWAITING RESPONSE.
3. **X duplicate content errors** — Many posts fail with 403. Poster correctly skips these, but reduces effective X throughput. May need unique content variants per platform.
4. **Sitemap URL gap** — 759 articles on disk but only 516 in sitemap. 243 new articles need deploy+sitemap regeneration.
5. **Writer throttle** — Founder override limits to 1 concurrent writer with 8h fallback. Hardware-writer currently active. 7 other writers queued.

## Recommendation
**The revised 1,500-article Month 1 target is on track.** With 759 articles and 206 new today (10 hours in), we're producing at ~93+/day — exactly what's needed. Focus areas: (1) **Monitor GSC closely over the next 48 hours** — Feb 18-20 impression data should start appearing, and we expect significant indexing acceleration with 759 articles now vs 516 in the last sitemap Google saw. First clicks should be imminent. (2) **Social remains the weakest metric** — 1 follower vs 1,000 target. X duplicate errors reduce effective posting. Consider: unique post variants per platform, thread-style content for engagement, or focusing Bluesky effort (where posts succeed) while resolving X duplicate issue. (3) **Content trajectory is strong** — 3.6x selfh.st, approaching 2x noted.lol. Topical authority is building.
