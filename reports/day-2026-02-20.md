- Articles published Feb 19: 2
- Articles published Feb 17: 56
- Articles published Feb 16: 496 (Day 1 burst)
- **Content velocity (7-day avg): ~80 articles/day** (637 articles over ~5 days, Feb 16-20)
- **Current velocity: RECOVERING STRONGLY.** 85 new articles today (as of 05:50 UTC), up from 6 at 01:45 UTC. Writers are clearly back online.
- To hit 5,000 by Feb 28: need ~545 articles/day for remaining 8 days. Still extremely ambitious but velocity trending up.

### Content Velocity Trend (RECOVERING)
| Date | New Articles | Cumulative | Daily Rate |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Feb 16 | 496 | 496 | 496/day |
| Feb 17 | 56 | 552 | 56/day |
| Feb 18 | 0 | 552 | 0/day |
| Feb 19 | 2 | 554 | 2/day |
| Feb 20 (so far, 05:50 UTC) | 85 | 637 | **85/day** (partial day — accelerating) |

**Analysis:** Velocity is clearly recovering. The coordinator v2.0 restart at ~01:20 UTC re-enabled writer sub-agents (3 concurrent: foundations-writer, hardware-writer, homeauto-notes-writer). 85 articles in ~4 hours = ~21/hour sustained rate. If this pace holds for a full day, that's ~500 articles/day — approaching Day 1 levels. Key new categories getting content: AI/ML apps (comfyui, flowise, langflow, localai, stable-diffusion-webui, tabby, text-generation-webui, vllm, whisper), search engines (searxng, whoogle, meilisearch, typesense, opensearch, elasticsearch, manticoresearch, sonic), and email (docker-mailserver, stalwart). The comparison article pipeline is also producing at high velocity (30 new comparisons today).

## SEO
- **New page 1 keywords (7-day):** 2 — "freshrss vs miniflux" (position 3.0), "miniflux vs freshrss" (position 5.0)
- **Total pages with impressions:** 9
- **Total impressions (7-day):** 24 (all on Feb 17)
- **Total clicks (7-day):** 0
- **Top performing pages by impressions:**
  1. `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 8 impressions, position 6.9
  2. `/compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/` — 4 impressions, position 4.5
  3. `/foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/` — 4 impressions, position 7.3
  4. `/compare/` (index page) — 2 impressions, position 4.0
  5. `/replace/google-dns/` — 2 impressions, position 6.0
- **Other pages with impressions:** appflowy-vs-affine (1, pos 7.0), cosmos-cloud-vs-yacht (1, pos 3.0), raspberry-pi-alternatives (1, pos 10.0), virtualization-hardware-compared (1, pos 9.0)
- **Indexing status:** 516 URLs submitted via sitemap, 0 confirmed indexed (GSC reporting lag — URL inspection confirms at least 1 indexed). 3 sitemap warnings on sitemap-0.xml.
- **Sitemap last downloaded by Google:** Feb 19 (sitemap-0.xml), Feb 18 (sitemap-index.xml)
- **Assessment:** For a 4-day-old domain, 9 pages with impressions and 2 page-1 keywords is ahead of expectations. Comparison articles and hardware guides are indexing fastest. With 637 articles now on disk, the next sitemap crawl should significantly expand Google's awareness of our content. GSC data has a 2-3 day lag — expect impressions data for Feb 18-20 to appear by Feb 21-22.

- **awesome-selfhosted:** Last build Feb 16. Need to diff for new apps since then.
- **linuxserver.io:** Automated doc updates only. No editorial content.
- **r/selfhosted wiki:** Not monitored (Reddit API blocked without OAuth).
- **Notable:** We now have **3x** the content of selfh.st and are pulling further ahead of noted.lol. If velocity sustains at today's rate, we will pass 1,000 articles within 2 days.
- No new keyword losses detected (too early — only 2 tracked keywords).

## Stale Content Alerts

- **NetBird v0.65.1 → v0.65.3:** HIGH priority (security fix). Alert sent to Operations Feb 19. Status: pending fix.
- **Strapi uses `:latest` tag:** MEDIUM priority — should pin to v5.36.1. NEW — noted for Operations.
- **Whisper uses `:latest` tag:** LOW priority — uses rolling tags by design.
- **Calibre-Web 0.6.24 → 0.6.26:** LOW priority (2 minor versions behind). Previously flagged.
- **Paperless-ngx 2.20.6 → 2.20.7:** LOW priority (1 patch version). Previously flagged.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GA4 API not enabled** — Requires: human. Cannot track traffic. Originally escalated Feb 16. Status: AWAITING RESPONSE.
2. **Social credentials pending** for Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode. Requires: human. Originally escalated Feb 16. Status: AWAITING RESPONSE.
3. **Content velocity recovering** — 85 new articles today vs 2 yesterday. Writers confirmed active. Rate: ~21/hour.
4. **Social poster rate** — Posting 1 item per 5-min cycle, alternating platforms. Working correctly. Queue: ~1,815 posts (~6 days to drain).
5. **3 GSC sitemap warnings** — unresolved, Technology investigating.
6. **Elasticsearch article uses v8 when v9 is latest** — significant staleness.

## Recommendation
**Content velocity is recovering — sustain and accelerate.** With 85 articles produced in the first 6 hours of today (~21/hour), the writer pipeline is clearly back online after the coordinator v2.0 restart. If this rate holds, expect 300-500 articles/day. Priority 1: Ensure all 8 writer sub-agents stay active and queued writers (5 more waiting) rotate in as current writers finish. Priority 2: Fix the Elasticsearch article (major version behind, v8→v9) and the NetBird security update. Priority 3: GA4 API enablement and social credential provisioning remain unresolved — both are needed for accurate traffic and engagement tracking.
