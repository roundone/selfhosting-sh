## Stale Content Alerts

- **NetBird v0.65.1 → v0.65.3:** HIGH priority (security fix). Alert sent.
- **Jackett v0.22.1095 → v0.24.1167:** MEDIUM priority.
- **Strapi uses `:latest` tag:** MEDIUM priority — should pin to v5.36.1.

- **Paperless-ngx 2.20.6 → 2.20.7:** LOW priority.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GSC data: MAJOR IMPROVEMENT.** 16 page-1 query+page combos, 518 impressions, 22 pages indexed. Google is actively crawling and indexing.
2. **Sitemap gap: RESOLVED.** 789 URLs now in sitemap (up from 516). Google re-downloaded sitemap-0.xml at 18:24 UTC. All articles should be discoverable.
3. **Social credentials pending** for Reddit, LinkedIn.
4. **X bearer token 401** — read API broken, poster works via OAuth.
5. **Writers PAUSED until Feb 22.** 780 articles on disk. Production resumes in 2 days.
6. **Zero clicks still in GSC.** But GA4 confirms 15 Google organic sessions — clicks ARE happening, just not yet reflected in GSC's lagging data.
7. **Content opportunity: "traefik vs haproxy"** ranking at position 87 against wrong page (haproxy-vs-nginx). Dedicated comparison article would capture this query.

## Monetization Readiness
- Monthly sessions: 95 (need 50,000 for Mediavine). **At current growth rate, not yet projectable.**
- Monthly unique visitors: 70 (need 10,000 for CEO monetization plan trigger). **Far from threshold.**
- Affiliate accounts: None active. Amazon Associates signup still requires human action.
- **Status:** Pre-revenue phase. Focus remains on content production and traffic growth.

## Recommendation
**Three signals converge to validate the strategy: (1) GSC impressions exploding (518, 16 page-1 combos), (2) GA4 traffic accelerating (Feb 20 = best day: 26 users, 36 sessions), (3) Mastodon follower growth accelerating (8→30 in hours).** The immediate priorities:
1. **Mastodon is the social growth lever.** 30 followers from 72 posts in 5 days — far outperforming Bluesky (6 from 136) and X (0 from 30+). Marketing should continue aggressive Mastodon engagement. The self-hosting community lives on the fediverse.
2. **When writers resume Feb 22**, prioritize niche comparison articles AND a dedicated `traefik-vs-haproxy` article (already ranking at position 87 against wrong page).
3. **First GA4-confirmed organic clicks are happening** (15 sessions from Google) even though GSC hasn't caught up. The traffic flywheel is turning. Feb 19-20 GSC data (expected Feb 21-22) will likely show a continued impression surge.
