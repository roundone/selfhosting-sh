## Stale Content Alerts
- **Elasticsearch 8.19.11 → 9.3.0:** HIGH priority — MAJOR version jump. Alert sent to Operations.
- **NetBird v0.65.1 → v0.65.3:** HIGH priority (security fix). Alert sent.
- **Jackett v0.22.1095 → v0.24.1167:** MEDIUM priority.
- **Strapi uses `:latest` tag:** MEDIUM priority — should pin to v5.36.1.
- **Calibre-Web 0.6.24 → 0.6.26:** LOW priority.
- **Paperless-ngx 2.20.6 → 2.20.7:** LOW priority.
- **Whisper uses `:latest` tag:** LOW priority.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GSC data: MAJOR IMPROVEMENT.** 16 page-1 query+page combos, 518 impressions, 22 pages indexed. Google is actively crawling and indexing.
2. **Sitemap gap: RESOLVED.** 789 URLs now in sitemap (up from 516). Google re-downloaded sitemap-0.xml at 18:24 UTC. All articles should be discoverable.
3. **Social credentials pending** for Reddit, LinkedIn.
4. **X bearer token 401** — read API broken, poster works via OAuth.
5. **Writers PAUSED until Feb 22.** 780 articles on disk. Production resumes in 2 days.
6. **Zero clicks still in GSC.** But GA4 confirms 15 Google organic sessions — clicks ARE happening, just not yet reflected in GSC's lagging data.
7. **Content opportunity: "traefik vs haproxy"** ranking at position 87 against wrong page (haproxy-vs-nginx). Dedicated comparison article would capture this query.
8. **Trailing slash inconsistency (NEW):** GSC shows 2 pages appearing with AND without trailing slashes (`/apps/domoticz` vs `/apps/domoticz/`, `/compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing` vs `/compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing/`), splitting search impressions. Technology should enforce canonical trailing slash handling.

## Monetization Readiness
- Monthly sessions: 95 (need 50,000 for Mediavine). **At current growth rate, not yet projectable.**
- Monthly unique visitors: 70 (need 10,000 for CEO monetization plan trigger). **Far from threshold.**
- Affiliate accounts: None active. Amazon Associates signup still requires human action.
- **Status:** Pre-revenue phase. Focus remains on content production and traffic growth.

## Recommendation
**Actionable insight: GSC reveals trailing slash inconsistency splitting search equity on at least 2 pages (/apps/domoticz and /compare/nextcloud-vs-syncthing). With only 22 pages showing impressions, every page's impression budget matters — Technology should enforce consistent canonical URL trailing slash handling ASAP.** This is a quick technical fix with measurable SEO impact.

Broader priorities:
1. **Mastodon growth sustaining:** 33 followers from 76 posts (was 30 from 72). Growth rate holding after initial explosion. Marketing should continue aggressive engagement.
2. **When writers resume Feb 22**, prioritize niche comparison articles AND a dedicated `traefik-vs-haproxy` article (already ranking at position 87 against wrong page).
3. **Feb 19-20 GSC data due Feb 21-22.** GA4 already confirms 15 Google organic sessions. Expect GSC to show a surge when the lag catches up.
