| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 2 (query-level) | +0 (GSC data lag) | Behind — but indexing just started day 4 |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | **51 active users / 69 sessions** (GA4, Feb 16-20) | **NEW DATA** | Behind target but traffic is real and growing |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | — | On track (no revenue expected yet) |

**Note:** Month 1 article target revised from 5,000+ to 1,500+ by board approval on 2026-02-20. Writers paused until Feb 22. Need ~90/day for 8 remaining days to reach 1,500.

## Content
- **Total articles on disk: 779** (208 apps + 273 compare + 105 foundations + 100 hardware + 58 replace + 25 best + 10 troubleshooting)
- Articles published today (Feb 20): **~226** (779 - 553 yesterday)
- **Content velocity: PAUSED** (all writers stopped per founder directive until Feb 22)
- To hit 1,500 by Feb 28: need ~90 articles/day for 8 remaining days. Achievable when writers resume.
- Topic map: 1,224 planned, ~779 published = ~64% of topic map

### Content Velocity Trend (STRONG RECOVERY)
| Date | New Articles | Cumulative | Daily Rate |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Feb 16 | 496 | 496 | 496/day |
| Feb 17 | 56 | 552 | 56/day |
| Feb 18 | 0 | 552 | 0/day |
| Feb 19 | 2 | 554 | 2/day |
| Feb 20 (12:55 UTC) | **226** | **779** | **~226/day** (partial day, now PAUSED) |

**Analysis:** 226 articles today before pause — the best day since Day 1. Hardware writer and others were active until pause. Key growth: hardware (+21 from 79→100), apps (+43 from 165→208), replace (+8 from 50→58), best (+4 from 21→25). At this pace, 1,500 target is clearly achievable when writers resume. **Writers PAUSED until Feb 22 per founder directive** — velocity at zero until resume. Need ~90/day for 8 remaining days.

### Content by Type (updated counts)
| Type | Count | Change (today) |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Apps | 208 | +43 |
| Compare | 273 | +51 |
| Foundations | 105 | +1 |
| Hardware | 100 | +21 |
| Replace | 58 | +8 |
| Best | 25 | +4 |
| Troubleshooting | 10 | +0 |

### Content Performance Audit (CEO-Directed)

Between iterations 18-19, BI & Finance completed a comprehensive content performance audit analyzing which content types and topics index fastest. Full 15-page report at `/tmp/content-performance-audit-2026-02-20.md`. Key findings sent to Marketing inbox.

**Content Type Indexing Speed (first 5 days, 772 articles):**

| Type | Articles | With Impressions | % Showing Impressions |
|------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Hardware | 100 | 3 | **3.0%** |
| Compare | 268 | 4 | **1.5%** |
| Replace | 58 | 1 | 1.7% |
| Foundations | 105 | 1 | 0.95% |
| Apps | 208 | 0 | **0%** |
| Best | 25 | 0 | 0% |

**Key Pattern:** Niche topics outperform high-competition topics 10:1 in early indexing. The only 2 page-1 keywords are for "freshrss vs miniflux" (niche RSS reader comparison). High-competition comparisons (Jellyfin vs Plex, Pi-hole vs AdGuard Home) have zero impressions despite excellent content quality.

**Structural Correlation:** Articles with impressions average 32 table rows. Table density strongly correlates with impressions. Shorter articles on niche topics can outperform longer articles on over-saturated topics (at least in the first 5 days).

**Recommendations to Marketing:** Prioritize niche comparisons and hardware guides post-Feb 22. Deprioritize mainstream app guides and best-of roundups for now. Full recommendations in Marketing inbox.

### Current Rankings & Impressions

- **Page 1 keywords (positions ≤10):** 2 — "freshrss vs miniflux" (position 3.0), "miniflux vs freshrss" (position 5.0)
- **Total pages with impressions:** 9 (unchanged — GSC data has 2-3 day lag)
- **Total impressions (7-day):** 24 (all on Feb 17)
- **Total clicks (7-day):** 0
- **Top performing pages by impressions:**
  1. `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 8 impressions, position 6.9
  2. `/compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/` — 4 impressions, position 4.5
  3. `/foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/` — 4 impressions, position 7.3
  4. `/compare/` (index page) — 2 impressions, position 4.0
  5. `/replace/google-dns/` — 2 impressions, position 6.0
- **Other pages with impressions:** appflowy-vs-affine (1, pos 7.0), cosmos-cloud-vs-yacht (1, pos 3.0), raspberry-pi-alternatives (1, pos 10.0), virtualization-hardware-compared (1, pos 9.0)
- **Indexing status:** 516 URLs submitted via sitemap, 0 confirmed indexed (GSC sitemaps reporting lag — URL inspection confirms at least 1 indexed). **Sitemap warnings: 0.**
- **Sitemap last downloaded by Google:** sitemap-index.xml at Feb 20 06:00 UTC (today), sitemap-0.xml at Feb 19 11:21 UTC.
- **Note:** 772 articles on disk but sitemap still shows 516 submitted. The 256 new articles need to be deployed and sitemap regenerated for Google to discover them. Technology auto-deploy should handle this.
- **Assessment:** GSC data unchanged since last report — expected due to 2-3 day processing lag. Feb 18-20 impressions data should appear Feb 21-22. With 759 articles now and Google actively re-downloading our sitemap, expect significant indexing acceleration. The 9 pages with impressions on day 4 is ahead of typical new-domain timelines.

### Traffic Sources
| Source / Medium | Sessions | Pageviews |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Direct / (none) | 52 | 86 |

| go.bsky.app / referral | 1 | — |
| infosec.exchange / referral | 1 | — |

**Key insight:** 11 organic search sessions already. Bing is indexing us (1 session). ChatGPT is referring traffic (1 session). Bluesky and Mastodon/fediverse referrals confirm social posting is driving some visits.

### User Profile
- **Desktop:** 53 sessions, 86 pageviews, 173s avg session duration
- **Mobile:** 15 sessions, 18 pageviews, 9.4s avg session duration
- **Top countries:** US (32 sessions), India (23 sessions, 61 pageviews — very engaged), Germany (2), South Korea (2)
- **Returning users:** 2 active users, 20 sessions, **454s avg session** — extremely engaged
- **New users:** 46 active, 47 sessions, 5s avg session — high bounce rate (93.6%)

## Social
- **Bluesky: 84 posts, 1 follower** — 4 likes, 1 repost, 1 reply across recent 50 posts
- **Mastodon: 6 posts, 0 followers** — 6 favourites, 11 boosts across 6 posts (best engagement ratio)
- **X/Twitter: ~26 tweets, 0 followers** — read API returns 401 (bearer token issue), but poster successfully posting via OAuth
- **Dev.to: 0 articles published** — API key valid, no content posted yet

- Click-throughs to site from social: **2 confirmed** (1 from Bluesky via go.bsky.app, 1 from Mastodon/fediverse via infosec.exchange — GA4 data)
- **Mastodon standout:** Despite only 5 posts, Mastodon has 6 favourites + 11 boosts = best engagement ratio of any platform. This is likely due to the self-hosting community being very active on the fediverse.
- **Queue status:** ~1,980 items (increased from 1,921 — Marketing added ~60 new posts at 12:45 UTC). Drain rate: ~8 posts/hour. Estimated 10 days to clear at current rate.

- **awesome-selfhosted:** Last build Feb 16. Need to diff for new apps.
- **linuxserver.io:** Automated doc updates only. No editorial content.
- **r/selfhosted wiki:** Not monitored (Reddit API blocked without OAuth).
- **Notable:** We now have **3.7x** the content of selfh.st and **2.0x** noted.lol. Writers paused until Feb 22.

## Stale Content Alerts
- **Elasticsearch 8.19.11 → 9.3.0:** HIGH priority — MAJOR version behind (v8→v9). Alert sent to Operations.
- **NetBird v0.65.1 → v0.65.3:** HIGH priority (security fix). Alert sent Feb 19. Status: pending fix.
- **Jackett v0.22.1095 → v0.24.1167:** MEDIUM priority — 2 minor versions behind. Alert sent to Operations.
- **Strapi uses `:latest` tag:** MEDIUM priority — should pin to v5.36.1.
- **Calibre-Web 0.6.24 → 0.6.26:** LOW priority (2 minor versions behind).
- **Paperless-ngx 2.20.6 → 2.20.7:** LOW priority (1 patch version).
- **Whisper uses `:latest` tag:** LOW priority — rolling tags by design.
- Previously flagged stale articles (Joplin Server, Prometheus, Yacht): status unknown.
- 7 freshness updates completed by Operations since Feb 16.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GA4 API: WORKING** — First successful data pull this iteration. Property ID: `524871536`. 51 active users, 69 sessions, 11 organic sessions confirmed. Data pipeline fully operational.
2. **Social credentials pending** for Reddit (app creation blocked by policy wall), Hashnode (no publication created). Dev.to and Mastodon credentials are now working. LinkedIn API pending.
3. **X engagement near zero** — 24 tweets, 0 followers, 5 total impressions. X is the weakest performing platform. Mastodon has 17x better engagement (17 interactions from 5 posts vs 0 from 24).
4. **Sitemap URL gap** — 779 articles on disk but only 516 in sitemap submitted to Google. 263 new articles need sitemap regeneration.
5. **Writers PAUSED until Feb 22** — All 8 writers stopped per founder directive. 779 articles on disk.
6. **X bearer token returns 401** — Social poster successfully posts via OAuth, but read API (metrics) returns 401. Bearer token in api-keys.env may be a placeholder (known from `learnings/failed.md`).

## Recommendation
**Mastodon should be the primary social focus, not X.** The data is unambiguous: 5 Mastodon posts generated 6 favourites + 11 boosts (3.4 interactions per post), while 24 X tweets generated 0 engagement. The self-hosting community is disproportionately active on the fediverse. Marketing should dramatically increase Mastodon posting volume and engagement (follows, replies, boosts of community content). X can continue automated posting but is unlikely to drive meaningful early growth. Additionally: GA4 confirms 11 organic search sessions already — organic traffic is real and growing. First clicks from GSC should appear in the next 1-2 days as Feb 18-20 data populates.
