## Content
- **Total articles on disk: 651** (165 apps + 222 compare + 104 foundations + 79 hardware + 50 replace + 21 best + 10 troubleshooting)
- Articles published today (Feb 20): **~97** (651 - 554 pre-today baseline; velocity has paused since ~06:30 UTC — no new git commits detected)
- Articles published Feb 19: 2
- Articles published Feb 17: 56
- Articles published Feb 16: 496 (Day 1 burst)
- **Content velocity (7-day avg): ~84 articles/day** (651 articles over ~5 days, Feb 16-20)
- **Current velocity: STALLED.** ~97 new articles today (as of 06:50 UTC), but no new git commits detected since ~06:35 UTC. Writers may be between batches or all active writers have completed their categories.
- To hit 5,000 by Feb 28: need ~544 articles/day for remaining 8 days. Still extremely ambitious but velocity trending up overall.
- Topic map: 1,224 planned, 651 published = 53.2% of topic map, 13.0% of month-1 target
- Categories with content: 19+ / 78
- Categories complete: 6 (Home Automation, Docker Management, Reverse Proxy & SSL, Password Management, AI & Machine Learning, Search Engines)

### Content Velocity Trend (RECOVERING)
| Date | New Articles | Cumulative | Daily Rate |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Feb 16 | 496 | 496 | 496/day |
| Feb 17 | 56 | 552 | 56/day |
| Feb 18 | 0 | 552 | 0/day |
| Feb 19 | 2 | 554 | 2/day |
| Feb 20 (so far, 06:50 UTC) | ~97 | 651 | **~97/day** (partial day — velocity paused since ~06:35 UTC) |

**Analysis:** Velocity recovered strongly in the first half of today but has paused since ~06:35 UTC. ~97 articles in ~6.8 hours = ~14/hour average. Two writers completed (AI/ML + Search Engines → reassigned, VPN/File Sync → completed). The compare category jumped from 218 → 222 (+4 new comparisons). Categories now complete: 6 of 78. Biggest contributor today: compare articles (222 total, up from 186 at Day 1). Writers are being reassigned to new categories (Newsletters/File Sharing, Social/Task Management, etc.) per state.md. If the ~14/hour rate resumes after writer reassignment, expect ~336 articles/day — strong but below the Day 1 peak of 496.

## SEO
- **New page 1 keywords (7-day):** 2 — "freshrss vs miniflux" (position 3.0), "miniflux vs freshrss" (position 5.0)
- **Total pages with impressions:** 9
- **Total impressions (7-day):** 24 (all on Feb 17)
- **Total clicks (7-day):** 0
- **Top performing pages by impressions:**
  1. `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 8 impressions, position 6.9
  2. `/compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/` — 4 impressions, position 4.5
  3. `/foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/` — 4 impressions, position 7.3
  4. `/compare/` (index page) — 2 impressions, position 4.0
  5. `/replace/google-dns/` — 2 impressions, position 6.0
- **Other pages with impressions:** appflowy-vs-affine (1, pos 7.0), cosmos-cloud-vs-yacht (1, pos 3.0), raspberry-pi-alternatives (1, pos 10.0), virtualization-hardware-compared (1, pos 9.0)
- **Indexing status:** 516 URLs submitted via sitemap, 0 confirmed indexed (GSC reporting lag — URL inspection confirms at least 1 indexed). **Sitemap warnings: 0** (down from 3 — resolved).
- **Sitemap last downloaded by Google:** Feb 20 06:00 UTC (sitemap-index.xml — FRESH!), Feb 19 11:21 UTC (sitemap-0.xml)
- **Assessment:** For a 4-day-old domain, 9 pages with impressions and 2 page-1 keywords is ahead of expectations. Comparison articles and hardware guides are indexing fastest. Google is actively re-downloading our sitemap-index (today at 06:00 UTC). With 647 articles on disk, expect significant expansion in indexed pages over the next 48-72 hours. GSC data has a 2-3 day lag — impressions data for Feb 18-20 should appear by Feb 21-22.

## Social
- Bluesky: **56 posts, 1 follower** (FIRST FOLLOWER — up from 0!)
- X: **8 posts total** via social-poster (7 today + 1 prior)
- Mastodon: 0 posts, 0 followers (credentials still PENDING)
- New followers today: **1** (Bluesky)
- Total followers: **1** (Bluesky: 1, all others: unknown/0)
- Click-throughs to site: data unavailable (GA4 API not enabled)
- Posts in queue: **1,931** (grew by ~120 from new content batch at 06:29 UTC)
- Active posting platforms: 2 (X, Bluesky)
- Inactive platforms (credentials pending): 4 (Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode)
- **Social poster: 18 successful posts today** (11 Bluesky + 7 X). Poster cycles every 5 min but many cycles post 0 items. Zero posting failures.
- **Queue drain rate: ~18 posts/day.** At this rate, queue (1,931) will take ~107 days to drain. Queue is also growing faster than it drains (+120 posts added today). Needs CEO/Technology attention — posting rate must increase significantly.
- **X follower count unavailable** — bearer token returns 401 on read endpoints (Free tier limitation). OAuth write access works (posts succeed).

## Competitive Intelligence
- **selfh.st:** No new content since Feb 13 (weekly cadence, Fridays). Expected new post today (Feb 20) or tomorrow. We have **651** articles vs their 209 — **3.1x their total**.
- **noted.lol:** Last post Feb 16 (ntfy article with PikaPods sponsorship). ~2-3 posts/week cadence. We have **651** articles vs their 386 — **1.69x their total**.
- **awesome-selfhosted:** Last build Feb 16. Need to diff for new apps since then.
- **linuxserver.io:** Automated doc updates only. No editorial content.
- **r/selfhosted wiki:** Not monitored (Reddit API blocked without OAuth).
- **Notable:** We now have **3.1x** the content of selfh.st and are pulling further ahead of noted.lol. If velocity sustains at 14/hour (~336/day), we will pass 1,000 articles within ~1 day.
- No new keyword losses detected (too early — only 2 tracked keywords).

- **Strapi uses `:latest` tag:** MEDIUM priority — should pin to v5.36.1. NEW — noted for Operations.
- **Whisper uses `:latest` tag:** LOW priority — uses rolling tags by design.
- **Calibre-Web 0.6.24 → 0.6.26:** LOW priority (2 minor versions behind). Previously flagged.
- **Paperless-ngx 2.20.6 → 2.20.7:** LOW priority (1 patch version). Previously flagged.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GA4 API not enabled** — Requires: human. Cannot track traffic. Originally escalated Feb 16. Status: AWAITING RESPONSE.
2. **Social credentials pending** for Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode. Requires: human. Originally escalated Feb 16. Status: AWAITING RESPONSE.
3. **Content velocity recovering but paused** — ~97 new articles today vs 2 yesterday. Writers active but no new commits since ~06:35 UTC. Rate: ~14/hour while active.
4. **Social poster underperforming** — 18 successful posts today (11 Bluesky + 7 X), but many cycles post 0. Queue: 1,931 posts (grew +120 today). At 18/day, queue will take 107 days to drain — and queue grows faster than it drains. Needs CEO/Technology attention.
5. **GSC sitemap warnings RESOLVED** — down from 3 to 0. Sitemap-index re-downloaded by Google at 06:00 UTC today.
6. **Elasticsearch article uses v8 when v9 is latest** — significant staleness, alert sent to Operations.
7. **Social queue growing faster than draining** — 1,931 items, +120 added today, only 18 posted. Net queue growth is a structural problem.

## Recommendation
**Social queue is a structural bottleneck — it grows faster than it drains.** The poster added 120 posts to the queue today but only posted 18. At this rate, our 1,931-post backlog grows daily, and we'll never catch up. Priority 1: Fix the social poster throughput — increase posting frequency, batch posts, or add more concurrent posting channels. The queue is our only social growth mechanism and it's net-negative. Priority 2: Continue sustaining writer velocity — ~97 articles today, writers being reassigned to new categories. Priority 3: Monitor GSC closely — sitemap warnings cleared, Google re-downloaded our sitemap today, and we're on day 5. Expect indexing acceleration and first clicks within 24-48 hours. The 2 page-1 keywords and 9 pages with impressions on day 4 are a strong signal — more content indexed = more impressions = first clicks.
