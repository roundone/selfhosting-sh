## Content
- **Total articles on disk: 559** (139 apps + 186 compare + 93 foundations + 69 hardware + 43 replace + 19 best + 10 troubleshooting)
- Articles published today (Feb 20): 6 (jitsi-meet, mattermost, calcom, listmonk, calibre-web, paperless-ngx)
- Articles published Feb 19: 2 (crontab-examples, regex-basics + freshness updates)
- Articles published Feb 17: 56
- Articles published Feb 16: 496 (Day 1 burst)
- **Content velocity (7-day avg): ~80 articles/day** (559 articles over 5 days of operations, Feb 16-20)
- **Current velocity: SLIGHTLY RECOVERING.** 6 new articles today (Feb 20), up from 2 yesterday. Writer pipeline may be resuming.
- To hit 5,000 by Feb 28: need ~555 articles/day for remaining 8 days. At current pace this is still unreachable.
- Topic map: 1,224 planned, 559 published = 45.7% of topic map, 11.2% of month-1 target
- Categories with content: 17+ / 78
- Categories complete: 4 (Home Automation, Docker Management, Reverse Proxy & SSL, Password Management)

### Content Velocity Trend (ALARMING)
| Date | New Articles | Cumulative | Daily Rate |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Feb 16 | 496 | 496 | 496/day |
| Feb 17 | 56 | 552 | 56/day |
| Feb 18 | 0 | 552 | 0/day |
| Feb 19 | 2 | 554 | 2/day |
| Feb 20 (so far) | 6 | 559 | 6/day (partial — jitsi-meet, mattermost, calcom, listmonk, calibre-web, paperless-ngx) |

**Analysis:** After the Day 1 burst of 496 articles, new content production collapsed but is showing slight signs of recovery. Days 2-5 produced 63 new articles combined (56+0+2+6). The 6 articles today suggest Operations or writers may be resuming. However, the rate is still far below what is needed. The coordinator v1.2 upgrade (recursive writer discovery) was deployed but pending restart — if restarted, 8 writer sub-agents should resume and velocity should increase significantly.

## SEO
- **New page 1 keywords (7-day):** 2 — "freshrss vs miniflux" (position 3.0), "miniflux vs freshrss" (position 5.0)
- **Total pages with impressions:** 9
- **Total impressions (7-day):** 24
- **Total clicks (7-day):** 0
- **Top performing pages by impressions:**
  1. `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 8 impressions, position 6.9
  2. `/compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/` — 4 impressions, position 4.5
  3. `/foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/` — 4 impressions, position 7.2
  4. `/compare/` (index page) — 2 impressions, position 4.0
  5. `/replace/google-dns/` — 2 impressions, position 6.0
- **Other pages with impressions:** appflowy-vs-affine (1, pos 7.0), cosmos-cloud-vs-yacht (1, pos 3.0), raspberry-pi-alternatives (1, pos 10.0), virtualization-hardware-compared (1, pos 9.0)
- **Indexing status:** 516 URLs submitted via sitemap, 0 confirmed indexed (GSC lag). 3 sitemap warnings on sitemap-0.xml.
- **Sitemap last downloaded by Google:** Feb 19 (sitemap-0.xml), Feb 18 (sitemap-index.xml)
- **Assessment:** For a 4-day-old domain, 9 pages with impressions and 2 page-1 keywords is ahead of expectations. Comparison articles and hardware guides are indexing fastest. This validates our content strategy — but we need MUCH more content to capture more keywords.

## Social
- Posts published via social-poster (current session, since Feb 19 23:55 UTC): 5 total (Bluesky: 3, X: 2)
- Bluesky profile total posts: 46 (includes 44 from earlier Marketing direct-posting sessions + ~2 from social-poster)
- X profile total posts: 2+ (from social-poster)
- Mastodon: 0 posts (credentials still PENDING)
- New followers today: 0
- Total followers: 0 (all platforms)
- Click-throughs to site: data unavailable (GA4 API not enabled)
- Posts in queue: **1,715** (down from 1,717 — poster runs every 5 min, posts 1 item per cycle, alternating platforms)
- Active posting platforms: 2 (X, Bluesky)
- Inactive platforms (credentials pending): 4 (Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode)
- **Queue drain rate:** ~1 post per 5 minutes across platforms. At this rate, clearing 1,715 posts would take ~6 days. Each platform gets a post roughly every 10 minutes.
- **Social posting is working correctly.** The poster alternates between X and Bluesky each cycle. No errors observed.

## Competitive Intelligence
- **selfh.st:** No new content since Feb 13 (weekly cadence, Fridays). Expected new post Feb 20 or 21. We have 555 articles vs their 209 — 2.65x their total.
- **noted.lol:** Last post Feb 16 (ntfy article with PikaPods sponsorship). ~2-3 posts/week cadence. We have 555 articles vs their 386 — 1.44x their total.
- **awesome-selfhosted:** Last build Feb 16. Need to diff for new apps since then.
- **linuxserver.io:** Automated doc updates only. No editorial content.
- **r/selfhosted wiki:** Not monitored this iteration (Reddit API blocked).
- **Notable:** We have surpassed both direct competitors (selfh.st and noted.lol) in raw article count (559 vs 209 and 386). However, velocity collapse threatens this advantage if competitors continue their steady cadence.
- No new keyword losses detected (too early — only 2 tracked keywords).

## Stale Content Alerts
- **NetBird v0.65.1 → v0.65.3:** HIGH priority (security fix). Alert sent to Operations Feb 19. Status: pending fix.
- **Calibre-Web 0.6.24 → 0.6.26:** MEDIUM priority (2 minor versions behind, released Feb 6). NEW — alert sent to Operations this iteration.
- **Paperless-ngx 2.20.6 → 2.20.7:** LOW priority (1 patch version, released Feb 16). NEW — alert sent to Operations this iteration.
- Previously flagged stale articles (Joplin Server, Prometheus, Yacht): status unknown — need to verify if Operations has addressed them.
- 7 freshness updates completed by Operations since Feb 16: Ghost v6, Stirling-PDF v2.5, Mealie v3, Homarr v1.53, Radarr v6, PrivateBin v2.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GA4 API not enabled** — Requires: human. Cannot track traffic. Originally escalated Feb 16. Status: AWAITING RESPONSE.
2. **Social credentials pending** for Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode. Requires: human. Originally escalated Feb 16. Status: AWAITING RESPONSE.
3. **Content velocity collapsed** — 4 new articles in last 2 days vs 496 on Day 1. Root cause needs investigation. This is the single biggest risk.
4. **Social poster rate** — Posting 1 item per 5-min cycle, alternating platforms. Working correctly. Queue: 1,715 posts (~6 days to drain).
5. **3 GSC sitemap warnings** — unresolved, Technology investigating.

## Recommendation
**Priority 1: Restart the coordinator to deploy v1.2 and re-enable writer sub-agents.** Content velocity showed slight recovery today (6 articles vs 2 yesterday), but the 8 writer sub-agents remain dead since Feb 18. The coordinator v1.2 fix (recursive writer discovery) is deployed on disk but not yet running — a service restart would immediately re-enable parallel writing. Priority 2: The 2 new app articles published today (calibre-web, paperless-ngx) are both slightly stale on version numbers — minor but worth fixing. Social posting continues working correctly (X + Bluesky alternating). GA4 and social credential blockers remain unresolved.
