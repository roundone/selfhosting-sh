# Daily Report — 2026-02-20

*Day 5 of operations. Data as of ~12:00 UTC (updated iter 20). Writers PAUSED per founder directive until Feb 22. **GA4 DATA NOW LIVE.***

## Scorecard
| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Delta vs Yesterday | Status |
|--------|-------------------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Articles published (total) | 1,500+ | 778 | +225 today | On track — 51.9% of revised target, 8 days remain (~90/day needed) |
| Page 1 keywords | 100+ | 2 (query-level) | +0 (GSC data lag) | Behind — but indexing just started day 4 |
| Monthly organic visits | 5,000 | **51 active users / 69 sessions** (GA4, Feb 16-20) | **NEW DATA** | Behind target but traffic is real and growing |
| Monthly revenue | $0-100 | $0 | — | On track (no revenue expected yet) |
| Referring domains | 10+ | 3 (chatgpt.com, go.bsky.app, infosec.exchange) | **NEW DATA** | Behind — but organic referrals starting |
| Social followers (all) | 1,000+ | 1 | +0 today | CRITICAL — 1 Bluesky follower |

**Note:** Month 1 article target revised from 5,000+ to 1,500+ by board approval on 2026-02-20. Writers paused until Feb 22. Need ~90/day for 8 remaining days to reach 1,500.

## Content
- **Total articles on disk: 778** (207 apps + 273 compare + 105 foundations + 100 hardware + 58 replace + 25 best + 10 troubleshooting)
- Articles published today (Feb 20): **~225** (778 - 553 yesterday)
- **Content velocity: PAUSED** (all writers stopped per founder directive until Feb 22)
- To hit 1,500 by Feb 28: need ~90 articles/day for 8 remaining days. Achievable when writers resume.
- Topic map: 1,224 planned, ~778 published = ~64% of topic map
- Categories with content: 23+ / 78
- Categories complete: 9 (Home Automation, Docker Management, Reverse Proxy & SSL, Password Management, AI & Machine Learning, Search Engines, Automation & Workflows, Wiki & Documentation, Foundations)

### Content Velocity Trend (STRONG RECOVERY)
| Date | New Articles | Cumulative | Daily Rate |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Feb 16 | 496 | 496 | 496/day |
| Feb 17 | 56 | 552 | 56/day |
| Feb 18 | 0 | 552 | 0/day |
| Feb 19 | 2 | 554 | 2/day |
| Feb 20 (11:30 UTC) | **219** | **772** | **~219/day** (partial day, accelerating) |

**Analysis:** Velocity remains strong. 219 articles today — the best day since Day 1. Hardware writer is actively producing. Writers being reassigned to new categories (Social Networks, Task Management, Music, Video Surveillance, etc.). Key growth: hardware (+21 from 79→100), apps (+39 from 165→204), replace (+8 from 50→58), best (+4 from 21→25). At this pace, 1,500 target is clearly achievable. The founder's 1-writer throttle means only hardware-writer is active right now; when other queued writers rotate in, velocity may increase further. **Writers now PAUSED until Feb 22 per founder directive** — velocity will drop to zero until resume.

### Content by Type (delta from last report)
| Type | Count | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| Apps | 204 | +39 |
| Compare | 260 | +38 |
| Foundations | 105 | +1 |
| Hardware | 100 | +21 |
| Replace | 58 | +8 |
| Best | 25 | +4 |
| Troubleshooting | 10 | +0 |

## SEO

### Content Performance Audit (CEO-Directed)

Between iterations 18-19, BI & Finance completed a comprehensive content performance audit analyzing which content types and topics index fastest. Full 15-page report at `/tmp/content-performance-audit-2026-02-20.md`. Key findings sent to Marketing inbox.

**Content Type Indexing Speed (first 5 days, 772 articles):**

| Type | Articles | With Impressions | % Showing Impressions |
|------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Hardware | 100 | 3 | **3.0%** |
| Compare | 268 | 4 | **1.5%** |
| Replace | 58 | 1 | 1.7% |
| Foundations | 105 | 1 | 0.95% |
| Apps | 208 | 0 | **0%** |
| Best | 25 | 0 | 0% |

**Key Pattern:** Niche topics outperform high-competition topics 10:1 in early indexing. The only 2 page-1 keywords are for "freshrss vs miniflux" (niche RSS reader comparison). High-competition comparisons (Jellyfin vs Plex, Pi-hole vs AdGuard Home) have zero impressions despite excellent content quality.

**Structural Correlation:** Articles with impressions average 32 table rows. Table density strongly correlates with impressions. Shorter articles on niche topics can outperform longer articles on over-saturated topics (at least in the first 5 days).

**Recommendations to Marketing:** Prioritize niche comparisons and hardware guides post-Feb 22. Deprioritize mainstream app guides and best-of roundups for now. Full recommendations in Marketing inbox.

### Current Rankings & Impressions

- **Page 1 keywords (positions ≤10):** 2 — "freshrss vs miniflux" (position 3.0), "miniflux vs freshrss" (position 5.0)
- **Total pages with impressions:** 9 (unchanged — GSC data has 2-3 day lag)
- **Total impressions (7-day):** 24 (all on Feb 17)
- **Total clicks (7-day):** 0
- **Top performing pages by impressions:**
  1. `/hardware/proxmox-hardware-guide/` — 8 impressions, position 6.9
  2. `/compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/` — 4 impressions, position 4.5
  3. `/foundations/reverse-proxy-explained/` — 4 impressions, position 7.3
  4. `/compare/` (index page) — 2 impressions, position 4.0
  5. `/replace/google-dns/` — 2 impressions, position 6.0
- **Other pages with impressions:** appflowy-vs-affine (1, pos 7.0), cosmos-cloud-vs-yacht (1, pos 3.0), raspberry-pi-alternatives (1, pos 10.0), virtualization-hardware-compared (1, pos 9.0)
- **Indexing status:** 516 URLs submitted via sitemap, 0 confirmed indexed (GSC sitemaps reporting lag — URL inspection confirms at least 1 indexed). **Sitemap warnings: 0.**
- **Sitemap last downloaded by Google:** sitemap-index.xml at Feb 20 06:00 UTC (today), sitemap-0.xml at Feb 19 11:21 UTC.
- **Note:** 772 articles on disk but sitemap still shows 516 submitted. The 256 new articles need to be deployed and sitemap regenerated for Google to discover them. Technology auto-deploy should handle this.
- **Assessment:** GSC data unchanged since last report — expected due to 2-3 day processing lag. Feb 18-20 impressions data should appear Feb 21-22. With 759 articles now and Google actively re-downloading our sitemap, expect significant indexing acceleration. The 9 pages with impressions on day 4 is ahead of typical new-domain timelines.

## Social
- **Bluesky: 74 posts, 1 follower** (up from 73 posts at last report; follower count unchanged)
- **X: posting active** — many posts attempted but hitting 403 duplicate content errors. Poster skips duplicates and moves to next item. Successful posts include roundups, comparisons, Docker tips.
- **Mastodon: 0 posts, 0 followers** (credentials PENDING)
- New followers today: **0** (since last report)
- Total followers: **1** (Bluesky: 1, all others: unknown/0)
- Click-throughs to site: data unavailable (GA4 API not enabled)
- Posts in queue: **1,942** (up from 1,914 — new content batch added)
- Active posting platforms: 2 (X, Bluesky)
- Inactive platforms (credentials pending): 4 (Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode)
- **X duplicate content issue:** X API returns 403 for many posts that are too similar to previously posted content. The social-poster now correctly skips these and moves to the next item. This reduces effective X posting throughput — unique content variants may be needed.
- **Queue status:** Queue grew from 1,914 → 1,942 (+28) due to new content batch. Queue was draining (1,931 → 1,914) earlier today before content batch. CEO's posting interval reduction (X 15min, Bluesky 10min) is working — net drain when no new content arrives. With writers paused until Feb 22, queue should drain steadily.

## Competitive Intelligence
- **selfh.st:** No new content since Feb 13 (weekly cadence, Fridays). Expected new post today (Feb 20) or tomorrow. We have **772** articles vs their 209 — **3.7x their total**.
- **noted.lol:** Last post Feb 16 (ntfy article with PikaPods sponsorship). ~2-3 posts/week cadence. We have **772** articles vs their 386 — **2.0x their total**.
- **awesome-selfhosted:** Last build Feb 16. Need to diff for new apps.
- **linuxserver.io:** Automated doc updates only. No editorial content.
- **r/selfhosted wiki:** Not monitored (Reddit API blocked without OAuth).
- **Notable:** We now have **3.7x** the content of selfh.st and **2.0x** noted.lol. At current velocity (before pause), we would have 1,000+ articles within 1-2 days. Writers now paused until Feb 22.
- No new keyword losses detected (too early — only 2 tracked keywords).

## Stale Content Alerts
- **Elasticsearch 8.19.11 → 9.3.0:** HIGH priority — MAJOR version behind (v8→v9). Alert sent to Operations.
- **NetBird v0.65.1 → v0.65.3:** HIGH priority (security fix). Alert sent Feb 19. Status: pending fix.
- **Jackett v0.22.1095 → v0.24.1167:** MEDIUM priority — 2 minor versions behind. Alert sent to Operations.
- **Strapi uses `:latest` tag:** MEDIUM priority — should pin to v5.36.1.
- **Calibre-Web 0.6.24 → 0.6.26:** LOW priority (2 minor versions behind).
- **Paperless-ngx 2.20.6 → 2.20.7:** LOW priority (1 patch version).
- **Whisper uses `:latest` tag:** LOW priority — rolling tags by design.
- Previously flagged stale articles (Joplin Server, Prometheus, Yacht): status unknown.
- 7 freshness updates completed by Operations since Feb 16.

## Issues & Escalations
1. **GA4 API now enabled** — RESOLVED (founder action between iters 18-19). Will pull traffic data on next iteration.
2. **Social credentials pending** for Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode. Requires: human. Originally escalated Feb 16. Status: AWAITING RESPONSE.
3. **X duplicate content errors** — Many posts fail with 403. Poster correctly skips these, but reduces effective X throughput. May need unique content variants per platform.
4. **Sitemap URL gap** — 772 articles on disk but only 516 in sitemap. 256 new articles need deploy+sitemap regeneration.
5. **Writer throttle** — Founder override limits to 1 concurrent writer with 8h fallback. Hardware-writer currently active. 7 other writers queued.

## Recommendation
**The revised 1,500-article Month 1 target remains on track.** With 772 articles and 219 new today (11.5 hours in), we're producing at ~91+/day — exactly what's needed. Writers are now paused until Feb 22 per founder directive. Focus areas during pause: (1) **Content performance audit findings should guide post-Feb 22 priorities.** The data is clear: hardware guides index at 3.0%, niche comparisons at 1.5%, app guides at 0%. Marketing should review the full audit and adjust writer priorities accordingly — prioritize niche comparisons and hardware guides, deprioritize mainstream app guides and best-of roundups. (2) **Monitor GSC closely over the next 48 hours** — Feb 18-20 impression data should start appearing, and we expect significant indexing acceleration with 772 articles now vs 516 in the last sitemap Google saw. First clicks should be imminent. (3) **GA4 data now available** — pull traffic metrics on next iteration to cross-validate GSC impressions/clicks. (4) **Social remains the weakest metric** — 1 follower vs 1,000 target. X duplicate errors reduce effective posting. Consider unique post variants per platform.
