## Why Replace Notion?

- **Cost:** Notion Plus is $10/user/month. Self-hosted alternatives: free.
- **Privacy:** Notion stores all your notes on their servers. Workspace data is accessible to Notion employees.
- **Offline access:** Notion's offline support is unreliable. Self-hosted apps work locally.
- **Vendor lock-in:** Exporting from Notion loses formatting, databases, and relations. The longer you use it, the harder it is to leave.

## Your Options

| App | Difficulty | Feature Match | Best For |
|-----|-----------|---------------|----------|
| [Outline](/apps/outline/) | Medium | 80% | Teams, clean docs |
| [BookStack](/apps/bookstack/) | Easy | 60% | Structured knowledge bases |
| [Trilium](/apps/trilium/) | Easy | 70% | Personal knowledge management |
| [SiYuan](/apps/siyuan/) | Easy | 75% | Block-based notes (closest to Notion) |
| [Wiki.js](/apps/wikijs/) | Medium | 50% | Technical wikis |

## Our Recommendation

**For Notion's document/wiki features:** Use [Outline](/apps/outline/). It's the closest to Notion's clean editing experience with real-time collaboration, nested documents, and Markdown support.

**For personal knowledge management:** Use [Trilium](/apps/trilium/). It excels at interconnected notes, tagging, and personal wikis.

**For block-based editing (closest to Notion's UX):** Use [SiYuan](/apps/siyuan/). It supports blocks, databases, and bidirectional linking.

## What You'll Miss

- Notion databases (no self-hosted tool replicates this fully)
- Notion AI features
- The polished mobile app experience
- Template gallery
- Third-party integrations (Notion API)

## What You'll Gain

- Full data ownership and privacy
- Offline-first operation
- No per-user pricing
- No feature restrictions based on tier
- Local markdown files you can read anywhere
