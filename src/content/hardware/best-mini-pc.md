## Why a Mini PC?

A mini PC is the sweet spot for self-hosting. More powerful than a Raspberry Pi, quieter and more efficient than a full server, and small enough to sit on a shelf. Most self-hosters will be perfectly served by a mini PC running Docker.

## Quick Picks

| Budget | Best Choice | CPU | RAM | Price |
|--------|------------|-----|-----|-------|
| Under $150 | Beelink Mini S12 Pro | Intel N100 | 16GB | ~$140 |
| $150-300 | Beelink SER5 | AMD Ryzen 5 5560U | 16GB | ~$250 |
| $300+ | Beelink SER7 | AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS | 32GB | ~$450 |

## The N100: The Self-Hosting Sweet Spot

The Intel N100 processor has become the go-to chip for self-hosting. It draws only 6W TDP, handles dozens of Docker containers without breaking a sweat, and supports hardware video transcoding via Intel Quick Sync. For most self-hosters running 10-30 containers, an N100-based mini PC is all you need.

## What to Look For

- **RAM:** 16GB minimum. 32GB if you plan to run memory-hungry apps like Nextcloud or Immich.
- **Storage:** NVMe SSD for the OS and Docker. Add an external USB drive or NAS for bulk storage.
- **Networking:** Gigabit Ethernet is essential. Dual NICs are a bonus for router/firewall setups.
- **Power consumption:** Under 15W idle is the target. Your electricity bill matters over years of 24/7 operation.

## Our Recommendation

Start with a **Beelink Mini S12 Pro** (Intel N100, 16GB RAM). It's under $150, whisper-quiet, and powerful enough for everything most self-hosters need. Upgrade to the SER5 or SER7 only if you need heavy transcoding or plan to run resource-intensive workloads.
