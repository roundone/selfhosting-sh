## Quick Answer

**Use Homarr** if you want a widget-rich dashboard with Docker integration and drag-and-drop editing. **Use Homepage** if you want a clean, minimal design with the best service integrations, configured via YAML. Both are excellent — it's a matter of preference.

## Overview

### Homarr
A modern dashboard with a visual editor, Docker integration, and rich widgets. Add apps, configure integrations, and rearrange your dashboard from the browser.

### Homepage
A clean, fast dashboard configured via YAML files. It has the best service integration ecosystem — showing real-time stats from Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, and 100+ other services directly on the dashboard.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Homarr | Homepage |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Configuration | Web UI (drag-and-drop) | YAML files |
| Service integrations | Good (Sonarr, Radarr, etc.) | Excellent (100+ services) |
| Docker integration | Yes (start/stop containers) | Yes (status display) |
| Widgets | Calendar, weather, media, RSS | Weather, search, stocks |
| Customization | Theme picker, layouts | CSS customization |
| Multiple boards | Yes | Yes (tabs) |
| Resource usage | Medium (~200MB) | Low (~80MB) |
| Setup time | 5 min | 10 min (YAML editing) |

## The Verdict

Both are great. **Choose Homarr** if you want a visual editor and Docker management features. **Choose Homepage** if you prefer YAML configuration and want the deepest service integrations.
