## Quick Picks

| Need | Best Choice | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| Best overall | [Immich](/apps/immich/) | Full Google Photos replacement with mobile app |
| Best for browsing | PhotoPrism | Mature, polished web interface |
| Most lightweight | Lychee | Simple, minimal resources |

## The Full Breakdown

### 1. Immich — Best Overall

Immich is the clear winner for most people. It's the only self-hosted solution that truly replaces Google Photos end-to-end: mobile auto-backup, facial recognition, map view, sharing, and a polished web UI. Development is fast and the community is massive.

**Best for:** Anyone replacing Google Photos or iCloud Photos.

### 2. PhotoPrism — Best for Browsing

PhotoPrism is a mature, stable option that excels at browsing and organizing large existing libraries. Its AI-powered search and classification are excellent. However, it lacks native mobile auto-backup.

**Best for:** People who already have their photos on a NAS and want a good way to browse them.

### 3. LibrePhotos

LibrePhotos focuses heavily on machine learning features like facial recognition and scene detection. The UI is functional but less polished than Immich or PhotoPrism.

### 4. Lychee

Lychee is a lightweight, simple photo management tool. It's fast and uses minimal resources, but lacks the advanced features of the top picks.

## How We Evaluated

We prioritized: mobile experience, feature completeness, ease of setup, community activity, and resource efficiency. For most self-hosters, the mobile backup feature is the most important differentiator.
