| Best overall | [Jellyfin](/apps/jellyfin/) | Free, open-source, hardware transcoding included |

## The Full Breakdown

### 1. Jellyfin — Best Overall

Jellyfin is a completely free, open-source media server. Every feature — hardware transcoding, live TV, mobile apps — is free with no account required. It's the natural choice for self-hosters who want full control.

**Strengths:** Free hardware transcoding, no account needed, active development, good plugin ecosystem.
**Weaknesses:** Client apps less polished than Plex on some platforms (Roku, Apple TV).

### 2. Plex — Best Client Apps

Plex has been the media server king for over a decade. Its client apps are the most polished, Plexamp for music is excellent, and features like Watch Together set it apart. The catch: hardware transcoding requires Plex Pass ($5/month or $120 lifetime).

**Strengths:** Best client apps, Plexamp music player, Watch Together, intro skipping.
**Weaknesses:** Plex Pass required for key features, account required, phones home to Plex servers, increasingly cluttered with streaming content.

### 3. Emby — Middle Ground

Emby sits between Jellyfin and Plex. It's the project Jellyfin forked from (when Emby went closed-source). It offers a polished experience with both free and premium tiers.

**Strengths:** Good balance of features and polish, Emby Premiere pricing competitive.
**Weaknesses:** Closed source, smaller community than Jellyfin or Plex, premium features locked behind paywall.

### 4. Navidrome — Best for Music

Navidrome is a lightweight music server with Subsonic API compatibility, meaning it works with dozens of existing music apps (Symfonium, Ultrasonic, play:Sub). If your primary use case is streaming your music library, Navidrome is lighter and more focused than running Jellyfin or Plex just for music.

**Strengths:** Extremely lightweight, Subsonic API (huge app ecosystem), great web UI.
**Weaknesses:** Music only — no video support.

### 5. Kavita — Best for Reading

Kavita is a media server built specifically for ebooks, comics, and manga. OPDS support lets you connect reading apps directly. Progress tracking, reading lists, and per-user libraries make it ideal for shared households.

**Strengths:** Built for reading, OPDS support, manga/comic optimization, reading progress sync.
**Weaknesses:** Reading only — no video or music.

## How We Evaluated

We prioritized: feature completeness, cost (free wins), open-source status, client app quality, hardware transcoding support, and community size. For self-hosting, open-source and free features weigh heavily — you're self-hosting to own your infrastructure, not to pay another subscription.
