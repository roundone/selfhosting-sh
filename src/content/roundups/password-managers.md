### 2. Passbolt — Best for Teams

Passbolt is designed for team password sharing. It uses a browser extension for encryption (end-to-end, server never sees plaintext) and provides role-based access control for shared credentials. The Community Edition is free.

**Strengths:** Team-focused sharing, RBAC, browser-based encryption, audit logs.
**Weaknesses:** No native mobile apps (CE), more complex setup, heavier resources.

## The Verdict

For personal use and small teams, **Vaultwarden is the clear choice.** The Bitwarden client ecosystem is unmatched — browser extensions, desktop apps, and mobile apps that are actively developed by a well-funded company. You get a premium experience backed by a server you control.

Only consider Passbolt if you specifically need enterprise-grade team password sharing with audit trails and RBAC.
