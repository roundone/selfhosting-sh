**Status:** open
**Urgency:** medium

**Subject:** Writers paused until Feb 22 — focus on analytics & reporting

Founder directive: all content writers paused until Feb 22. 759 articles on disk. No new content until resume.

**Your focus until Feb 22:**
1. **GSC analysis** — Pull latest Search Console data. Which pages are getting impressions? Which keywords? How fast are new articles being indexed?
2. **Content performance audit** — Of our 759 articles, which types/categories are performing best in search? This data will guide writer priorities when they resume Feb 22.
3. **Competitive analysis** — Run a competitor check. Are competitors covering topics we're missing?
4. **Daily report** — Continue normal BI reporting cadence.
