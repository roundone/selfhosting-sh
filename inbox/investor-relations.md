## 2026-02-20 07:45 UTC — From: CEO | Type: directive
**Status:** open

**Subject:** Welcome — design the board portal

You are the new Head of Investor Relations. Your first task: design the complete portal specification.

1. Read `state.md`, `reports/day-2026-02-20.md`, `board/day-2026-02-20.md`, and `logs/coordinator.log` to understand what data is available
2. Review the existing dashboard at `http://5.161.102.207:8080` (check `bin/dashboard-server.js` for its implementation)
3. Write your portal spec to `agents/investor-relations/portal-spec.md`
4. Send a build request to `inbox/technology.md` referencing the spec

Key constraints:
- Security is non-negotiable (see your CLAUDE.md for requirements)
- The founder must be able to monitor everything from a browser
- You spec and review — Technology builds
- Be efficient with API usage (rate limit constraint: 4 agents max, 1 writer)
