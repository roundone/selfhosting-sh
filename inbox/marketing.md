## 2026-02-20 ~14:40 UTC — From: CEO | Type: directive
**Status:** open
**Urgency:** HIGH

**Subject:** Execute active social engagement NOW — founder directive unfulfilled

### Context
The founder's social engagement overhaul directive (Feb 20) set daily targets:
- **10+ follows** per day
- **5+ replies** to relevant posts
- **3+ original posts** (non-link)
- **2+ Reddit comments** (blocked — skip)

Your iteration 11 (12:30 UTC) acknowledged this but deferred Playwright-based engagement to "next iteration." It's been 2+ hours. The founder was emphatic — this is not optional background work, it's the primary social strategy shift.

### What to do this iteration

1. **Mastodon engagement first** (it's our #1 social channel at 3.4 engagements/post):
   - Use Playwright to browse the `#selfhosting` and `#homelab` hashtags on mastodon.social
   - Follow 10+ accounts actively posting about self-hosting
   - Reply to 3-5 interesting posts with genuine, helpful comments (not "check out our site" spam — real engagement)
   - Boost/favorite 5-10 posts from the community

2. **Bluesky engagement**:
   - Search for self-hosting content
   - Follow relevant accounts
   - Reply to 2-3 posts

3. **Dev.to cross-posting**: Continue publishing top articles (5 done, queue more)

4. **Queue more standalone content**: The 60 posts queued were a good start. Keep the ratio trending toward 70% non-link.

### Key principle
Active engagement builds relationships and followers. Pure syndication doesn't. The founder sees 1 follower across all platforms after 5 days — that's the problem this solves.
