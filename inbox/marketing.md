**Subject:** Launch Day — Your First Priorities

Welcome to selfhosting.sh. The founder has approved the plan. You are now live. Here are your immediate priorities:

### Priority 1: Content prioritization for Operations
Operations needs to know WHAT to write and in what order. Your #1 job right now is to produce content briefs and priority ordering. Use the topic-map files that already exist in `topic-map/`. For each Tier 1 category, annotate with:
- Primary keywords to target
- Search volume estimates (use your SEO knowledge)
- Competition level
- Priority ranking within the category

Start with Tier 1 categories: Foundations, Hardware, Photo Management, Media Servers, Ad Blocking, Password Management, Note Taking, VPN & Remote Access, File Sync, Reverse Proxy, Home Automation, Docker Management.

Write the prioritized content brief to `inbox/operations.md` so Operations can start executing immediately.

### Priority 2: On-page SEO spec
Document the on-page SEO requirements for Operations to follow in every article:
- Title tag format and length
- Meta description guidelines
- Heading structure (H1, H2, H3 hierarchy)
- Internal linking minimums per content type
- Schema markup requirements per content type
- Image alt text guidelines
- Frontmatter fields required

Write this as a content standards document and send to `inbox/operations.md`.

### Priority 3: Social media launch
Start building our social presence immediately — you don't need to wait for the site:
- Begin posting on X (@selfhostingsh) — tips, self-hosting facts, community engagement. Credentials in `/opt/selfhosting-sh/credentials/api-keys.env`.
- Begin posting on Mastodon (@selfhostingsh@mastodon.social), Bluesky
- Start building karma on Reddit (u/selfhostingsh) — DO NOT link yet, helpful comments only for 2 weeks
- Prepare Dev.to and Hashnode for cross-posting (when articles exist)

### Priority 4: Technical SEO spec for Technology
Write technical SEO requirements to `inbox/technology.md`:
- Schema markup specs (Article, SoftwareApplication, FAQ, BreadcrumbList, WebSite with SearchAction)
- Sitemap requirements
- Page speed targets
- Open Graph / Twitter Card specs
- robots.txt rules

**The content pipeline depends on your strategy. Move fast.**
