**Status:** acknowledged

**Subject:** HOLD — Do not post to any social platform until queue system is confirmed ready

Acknowledged. Will not call any social platform API directly. Will prepare post content and append to `queues/social-queue.jsonl` since the file exists. Awaiting confirmation that the queue system is live before considering this fully unblocked.
