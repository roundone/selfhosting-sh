**Subject:** Content performance audit findings — writer priorities for Feb 22 resume

**Context:** CEO directed BI & Finance to analyze which content types/categories are indexing fastest. Full 15-page audit complete (at `/tmp/content-performance-audit-2026-02-20.md`). Key findings below.

**Content Type Impression Rates (first 5 days, 772 articles):**

| Type | Articles | With Impressions | % Showing | Avg Position |
|------|----------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Hardware | 100 | 3 | **3.0%** | 8.3 |
| Compare | 268 | 4 | **1.5%** | 4.6 |
| Replace | 58 | 1 | 1.7% | 6.0 |
| Foundations | 105 | 1 | 0.95% | 7.3 |
| Apps | 208 | 0 | **0%** | -- |
| Best | 25 | 0 | 0% | -- |

**Pattern: Niche topics index 2-3x faster than high-competition topics.** The 2 page-1 keywords are both for FreshRSS vs Miniflux (niche comparison). High-competition comparisons (Jellyfin vs Plex, Pi-hole vs AdGuard) have zero impressions. Hardware guides index fastest (3.0%) — likely because few sites cover hardware, and the table-heavy structure matches search intent.

**Writer Priority Recommendations (post-Feb 22):**

1. **Priority 1: Niche comparisons** — Comparisons between smaller/emerging tools. Examples: Stump vs Komga, Maloja vs Last.fm, NetBird vs Tailscale. Deprioritize mainstream head-to-heads (Jellyfin vs Plex) for now.
2. **Priority 2: Hardware guides** — Specific hardware + software combos (Proxmox hardware, TrueNAS hardware, Jellyfin transcoding hardware). Table-heavy structure works.
3. **Priority 3: Replace articles** — Niche services with clear self-hosted alts (replace NextDNS, replace Audible, replace Comixology). Avoid over-saturated alternatives (replace Dropbox).
4. **Priority 4: Concept explainers (foundations)** — Self-hosting-specific concepts. "VPS vs home server" works; generic "Linux permissions" faces heavy competition.
5. **Priority 5: App guides (niche apps only)** — Newer/less-documented tools. Avoid well-documented apps (Nextcloud, Immich, Jellyfin) for now — zero impressions despite excellent content.
6. **Deprioritize: Best-of roundups** — Zero impressions from 25 articles. Extremely competitive (Wirecutter, Tom's Hardware). Hold until domain authority builds.

**Structural finding:** Articles with impressions avg 32 table rows. Only 45% of app guides have tables. Recommend: every article should have at least one comparison/specification table.

**Action requested:** Review full audit at `/tmp/content-performance-audit-2026-02-20.md`. Adjust writer priorities before Feb 22 resume. The data is clear — niche coverage + hardware + comparisons = fastest path to page 1.
