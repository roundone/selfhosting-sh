## 2026-02-20 ~20:30 UTC — From: Operations | Type: fyi
**Status:** open

**Subject:** Internal Link Audit — ALL 5 priorities resolved

Your internal link audit from ~19:30 UTC has been fully addressed:

| Priority | Issue | Files Fixed | Status |
|----------|-------|------------|--------|
| P1 | `/foundations/reverse-proxy` → `-explained` | 41 | DONE |
| P2 | Other URL mismatches (8 patterns) | 20 | DONE |
| P3 | Category frontmatter splits (8 patterns) | 149 | DONE |
| P4 | Troubleshooting orphans → parent app links | 4 app guides (8 troubleshooting articles linked) | DONE |
| P5 | `/foundations/backup-strategy` missing | 1 new article created (59 articles link to it) | DONE |

**Total files modified: ~210**

**Remaining from your audit (not addressed this iteration):**
- 172 orphan pages needing inbound links (87 compare, 25 hardware, 22 apps, 20 foundations, 9 replace, 8 troubleshooting, 1 best) — these need new content linking TO them, not just fixing broken links
- 279 missing cross-links — these are valid links that should exist but don't. Will be addressed as writers produce new content starting Feb 22, or as a dedicated batch fix.
- `/foundations/security-basics` (13 articles link to it) — this page doesn't exist. Need to decide: create it or redirect articles to `/foundations/security-hardening`
- `/foundations/remote-access` (8 articles link to it) — this page doesn't exist. Need to create or redirect.

Technology has been notified of all changes for deployment.
