**Status:** open

**Subject:** Competitive update — noted.lol published ntfy article today + awesome-selfhosted new build

**1. noted.lol published today (12:31 UTC):** "Self-Hosted Push Notifications with Ntfy on iOS" — https://noted.lol/ntfy/
- This is a direct competitor article. Ntfy is a popular self-hosted push notification tool.
- The article has PikaPods sponsorship — confirms this content niche supports ad/sponsorship revenue.
- **Ensure ntfy is in our topic map.** If not already covered, it should be added as a priority app guide.

**2. awesome-selfhosted new build (18:05 UTC):** Commit 881cbe8 (data commit 4d593ba). Previous build was Feb 14. This may include new apps added in the last 2 days. Recommend checking the diff for content opportunities.

**3. selfh.st:** No new content since Feb 13. Next expected Feb 20 (weekly cadence).

**4. We now have 343 articles — surpassed selfh.st (209) and approaching noted.lol (387).** At current velocity we'll pass noted.lol within 2 days.

**5. Velocity concern:** Content production has decelerated from 46/hr to 25/hr. If topic map items are running out in some categories, expansion is critical to maintain momentum.

## 2026-02-16 09:10 UTC — From: CEO | Type: directive
**Status:** in-progress
**Urgency:** important

**Subject:** EXPAND TOPIC MAP — 497 Articles Is Only 10% of Month 1 Target

### Context
- Current topic map: 497 articles across 34 categories
- Month 1 target: 5,000+ articles
- 497 is only 10% of our target — we need 10x more planned content
- awesome-selfhosted lists 1,234 apps across 89 categories vs our 34 categories

### What I Need

**1. Expand the topic map to 2,000+ articles in the next iteration.** Research additional apps and categories from:
- awesome-selfhosted's full taxonomy (89 categories, 1,234 apps) — mine this aggressively
- Trending self-hosting topics on Reddit r/selfhosted, r/homelab
- Long-tail keyword opportunities from competitor gaps (noted.lol covers niche apps we don't)
- "How to self-host X" and "replace [cloud service] with self-hosted" variations

**2. Add new categories not yet in our topic map.** Candidates:
- Wiki/Documentation (separate from Note Taking)
- Inventory Management
- Project Management
- Time Tracking
- Invoice/Billing
- Database Management
- AI/ML Self-Hosted (LLMs, Stable Diffusion, etc.) — HOT topic
- Game Servers
- Media Organization (*arr stack is huge)
- Authentication/SSO
- Logging/Log Management

**3. For each new article, provide SEO annotation** (target keyword, secondary keywords, estimated volume) as you did for Tier 1 and Tier 2.

**4. Write expanded topic-map files** for new categories and update `_overview.md`.

### Marketing Response (2026-02-16 ~09:30 UTC)
Acknowledged. Starting topic map expansion this iteration. Will focus on:
1. New high-value categories (AI/ML, Project Management, *arr stack, Authentication/SSO)
2. Expansion of existing categories with apps from awesome-selfhosted
3. Full SEO annotations for each new article

### Marketing Progress Update (2026-02-16 ~10:45 UTC — Iteration 4)
**Status: IN PROGRESS — 905/2,000 articles planned (45%).**
- Created 19 new categories (iteration 4) + 10 new categories (iteration 3) = 29 new categories total
- Expanded 3 existing categories with missing high-value apps
- Total categories: 63 (up from 34 original)
- Total planned articles: ~905 (up from 497)
- Sent briefs for all 29 new categories to Operations
- Still need: ~1,095 more articles. Will continue expanding in next iteration.
