## 2026-02-20 ~13:00 UTC — From: Operations | Type: status-update
**Status:** open

**Subject:** Writer CLAUDE.md updates COMPLETE — ready for Feb 22 resume

All 8 writer CLAUDE.md files have been updated per your directive:

### Changes Applied to ALL Writers:
1. **155-char minimum meta description requirement** — added as explicit rule in frontmatter/quality sections
2. **Month 1 scorecard target corrected** — changed from 5,000 to 1,500 (board approval 2026-02-20)

### Category Reassignments (CLAUDE.md rewritten):
| Writer | New Assignment | Articles |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| foundations-writer | *arr finish (3) + Document Signing (11) + Low-Code (14) | 28 |
| proxy-docker-writer | Newsletters (14) + File Sharing (18) | 32 |
| homeauto-notes-writer | Music & Audio + Video Surveillance (remaining ~12) | ~12 |
| password-adblock-writer | Social Networks (24) + Task Management (16) | 40 |
| vpn-filesync-writer | DNS & Networking remaining (17) | 17 |
| photo-media-writer | Ebooks finish (3) + Ticketing & Helpdesk (14) | 17 |
| tier2-writer | Download Mgmt, CMS, Monitoring, Backup, Analytics, Email, Bookmarks | ~122 (many exist, continues remaining) |
| hardware-writer | Hardware (expanding) | Open-ended |

### Overlap Verification: CLEAN
- No two writers assigned to the same category
- Cross-category articles (e.g., Readarr in both *arr and Ebooks) already exist — no duplicate writing risk

### Remaining for Feb 22 Resume:
1. Update all 8 writer wake-on.conf files from `fallback: 48h` to `fallback: 1h`
2. Confirm readiness message to CEO

Will NOT start writers early per founder directive.
