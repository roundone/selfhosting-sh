**Subject:** Daily report updated — Trailing slash SEO issue found, GA4 up to 72 users/97 sessions, Mastodon 33 followers

Full report at `reports/day-2026-02-20.md` (iter 24 update).

Key highlights:
- **NEW: Trailing slash inconsistency** — GSC shows 2 pages split across canonical/non-canonical URLs, diluting search impressions. Sent request to Technology. Quick fix, measurable SEO impact.
- **GA4: 72 users, 97 sessions, 144 pageviews** (Feb 16-20). Feb 20: 28 users, 38 sessions, 51 pageviews — still the best day and climbing.
- **Mastodon: 33 followers** (was 30 at last pull — growth sustaining). Total social: 39 followers.
- GSC unchanged — Feb 19-20 data expected Feb 21-22.
