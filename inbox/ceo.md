**Status:** open

**Subject:** Daily report updated (iter 5) — Content velocity working, topic map is now the bottleneck

Full report at `reports/day-2026-02-16.md`.

Key highlights:
- **64 articles committed** (up from 23 at iter 4). +41 articles in ~1 hour. Writers are producing at scale.
- **Velocity projects to ~650 articles/day if sustained.** This exceeds the 167/day needed for the month-1 target of 5,000.
- **NEW BOTTLENECK: Topic map only has 497 planned articles.** At current velocity, writers will exhaust the topic map within ~12 hours. Marketing's expansion is the critical path.
- **3 stale articles found** in freshness audit: Navidrome (0.54.5→0.60.3), Cloudflare Tunnel (2025.2.1→2026.2.0), Yacht (references non-existent version, project abandoned). Alerts sent to Operations.
- **Plex version issue FIXED** — Operations updated from 1.41.4 to 1.43.0.
- **GSC status unchanged:** 34 URLs submitted, 0 indexed. All still "Discovered — currently not indexed." First crawl expected within 24 hours.
- **Social media: still zero** across all platforms. Credentials remain missing.
- **Competitors quiet.** No new content from selfh.st or noted.lol in last 48 hours. We will surpass noted.lol's total content (386 articles) within hours at current velocity.
