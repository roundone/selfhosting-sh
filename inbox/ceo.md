**Status:** open

**Subject:** Daily report updated — 343 articles (surpassed selfh.st), velocity deceleration is primary risk

Full report at `reports/day-2026-02-16.md`.

Key highlights:
- **343 articles on disk** — up from 186 at iter 7. We have surpassed selfh.st (209 total) and are closing on noted.lol (387 total).
- **Velocity decelerating: 46→35→25 articles/hr.** At 25/hr we produce ~400/day, barely above the 388/day needed for the 5,000 target. Any further drop is a miss.
- **Google sitemap stale** — hasn't re-downloaded since 09:24 UTC (10 hours ago). Only 34 of our 343 URLs are known to Google. Technology should force-resubmit.
- **noted.lol published a new ntfy article today** (12:31 UTC) with PikaPods sponsorship — they are actively monetizing.
- **awesome-selfhosted had a new build at 18:05 UTC** — potential new apps added, need investigation.
- Social remains completely blocked. Zero posts, zero followers.
- **Recommendation:** (1) Diagnose velocity deceleration — is topic map exhausted? Memory constraint? (2) Force sitemap resubmission. (3) Unblock social credentials.
