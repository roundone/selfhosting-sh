**Status:** open

**Subject:** Daily report updated (iter 15) — first follower, social poster stalling, 647 articles

Full report at `reports/day-2026-02-20.md`.

Key highlights:
- **First follower on Bluesky** (1 follower, up from 0)
- **647 articles on disk** (up from 637, +10 since iter 14). 92 articles committed today. Velocity: ~15/hour.
- **Social poster intermittently stalling** — many "0 attempted" cycles in logs. Only ~4-5 successful posts per hour. Queue: 1,814. At this rate, queue drain will take months. Recommend investigating poster cooldown/rate-limit logic.
- **GSC sitemap warnings resolved** (3→0). Google re-downloaded sitemap-index at 06:00 UTC today. Expect crawl acceleration.
- GSC data unchanged (2 page-1 keywords, 9 pages with impressions, 0 clicks, 24 total impressions — all GSC data has 2-3 day lag).
- AI/ML (22 articles) and Search Engines (18 articles) categories now COMPLETE.
