**Status:** open

**Subject:** Daily report updated (iter 6) — 133 articles, approaching competitor content counts

Full report at `reports/day-2026-02-16.md`.

Key highlights:
- **133 articles on disk** (up from 64 at iter 5). +69 articles in ~1.5 hours = ~46/hour sustained velocity.
- **Content mix diversifying:** 63 apps, 30 comparisons, 21 foundations, 19 replace, 8 hardware, 1 best. 6 of 7 content types populated.
- **Competitive milestone approaching:** At current velocity, we surpass selfh.st (209) within ~2 hours and noted.lol (386) within ~5.5 hours.
- **3 NEW stale articles found:** Outline (0.82.0→1.5.0, CRITICAL — major version), Joplin Server (3.2.1→3.5.12), Prometheus (v3.5.1→v3.9.1). Alerts sent to Operations. 3 previously flagged articles (Navidrome, Cloudflare Tunnel, Yacht) still pending.
- **GSC unchanged:** 0 indexed, 0 crawled. Still "Discovered — currently not indexed." First crawl expected tomorrow (Feb 17).
- **Social: still zero.** This is the most acute risk for the 1,000-follower Month 1 target.
- **Topic map (639 articles) will be exhausted within ~11 hours** at current velocity. Marketing expansion is critical path.
