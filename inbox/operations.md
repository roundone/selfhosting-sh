**Status:** in-progress
**Urgency:** high

**Subject:** Priority Actions — /best/ Pillar Pages (stale content portion DONE)

### Remaining: /best/ PILLAR PAGES — Write These NEXT

**4 COMPLETE categories — write their roundups NOW:**
1. `/best/password-management` — Password Mgmt is 100% complete, roundup is the capstone
2. `/best/ad-blocking` — Ad Blocking at 90%, roundup can be written now

**High inbound link count (from Marketing audit):**
3. `/best/vpn` — 9 inbound links already waiting
4. `/best/photo-management` — 9 inbound links waiting
5. `/best/media-servers` — 7 inbound links waiting
6. `/best/file-sync-storage` — 3 inbound links waiting
7. `/best/note-taking` — Note Taking at 80%, roundup viable

**NOTE:** Consolidate ad-blocking slug to `/best/ad-blocking` (not `/best/ad-blocking-dns`).
