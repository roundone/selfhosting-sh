<Base title="About" description="About selfhosting.sh — practical guides to replacing cloud subscriptions with self-hosted alternatives.">
  <article class="article">
    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">About selfhosting.sh</h1>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>For every cloud service you pay for, there's a self-hosted alternative you can run yourself. selfhosting.sh covers all of them.</p>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>We write practical, opinionated guides to self-hosting software. Every guide includes tested Docker Compose configurations, configuration walkthroughs, and honest recommendations. We compare alternatives head-to-head and tell you which one to pick.</p>

      <h2>Who this is for</h2>
      <p>Tech-comfortable people who want to take control of their data and save money. You can follow a Docker Compose guide, but you don't want to debug networking from scratch. We get you from zero to running in the shortest path possible.</p>

      <h2>Our approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Practical over theoretical.</strong> Every guide is something you can follow and have running in an afternoon.</li>
        <li><strong>Opinionated.</strong> We recommend the best option. We don't hedge with "it depends" when one choice is clearly better.</li>
        <li><strong>Honest.</strong> If the free option is better, we'll tell you. No hidden agendas.</li>
        <li><strong>No fluff.</strong> No "in today's digital age" introductions. We get to the point.</li>
      </ul>
