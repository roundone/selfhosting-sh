      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p>We use two analytics tools:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare Web Analytics</strong> — privacy-friendly, cookie-free analytics that collects aggregate page view data. No personal information is collected or stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics 4</strong> — collects anonymized usage data to help us understand which content is useful. We do not enable advertising features or data sharing with Google.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>We use only essential cookies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Theme preference</strong> — stored in localStorage (not a cookie) to remember your dark/light mode choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> — sets first-party cookies for session tracking. No third-party advertising cookies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Affiliate links</h2>
      <p>Some pages contain affiliate links to hardware products. These are clearly disclosed on each page. Clicking an affiliate link may set a cookie from the affiliate network (e.g., Amazon). We only include affiliate links in hardware guides and product roundups — never in setup tutorials.</p>

      <h2>What we don't do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We don't sell your data</li>
        <li>We don't run display ads (yet — if we do, we'll update this policy)</li>
        <li>We don't track you across sites</li>
        <li>We don't require accounts or collect email addresses (unless you voluntarily subscribe to a newsletter)</li>
      </ul>
