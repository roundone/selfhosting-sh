## Quick Recommendation

If your NAS or file server bottlenecks on Gigabit Ethernet (125 MB/s max), upgrade to **2.5GbE**. Get a **TRENDnet TEG-S350 5-port 2.5GbE switch** (~$60) and a **Realtek RTL8156B USB 3.0 to 2.5GbE adapter** (~$15) for machines without built-in 2.5GbE. Most Intel N100 mini PCs already have 2.5GbE built in. Skip 10GbE unless you have specific multi-stream NAS workloads — 2.5GbE is the sweet spot for homelabs.

## Why 2.5GbE?

Gigabit Ethernet maxes out at ~125 MB/s. That was fine when hard drives were slow, but modern SSDs read at 500+ MB/s, and even HDDs in RAID can exceed 125 MB/s. The result: your network is the bottleneck, not your storage.

| Standard | Speed | Max Throughput | Cable Required | Cost Premium |
|----------|-------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 GbE | 1 Gbps | ~125 MB/s | Cat5e | Baseline |
| **2.5 GbE** | **2.5 Gbps** | **~312 MB/s** | **Cat5e** | **Low** |
| 5 GbE | 5 Gbps | ~625 MB/s | Cat5e | Medium |
| 10 GbE | 10 Gbps | ~1.25 GB/s | Cat6a / DAC | High |

**2.5GbE is the upgrade sweet spot because:**
- **2.5x the speed** of Gigabit — 312 MB/s vs 125 MB/s
- **Works on existing Cat5e cables** — no rewiring
- **Affordable** — switches cost $50-80, adapters cost $15
- **Built into most new hardware** — Intel N100 mini PCs, modern motherboards, and many NAS units include 2.5GbE
- **Low power** — virtually no additional power consumption vs Gigabit

## When to Upgrade

**Upgrade to 2.5GbE if:**
- You transfer large files to/from a NAS regularly (video editing, photo libraries, backups)
- Your NAS has SSDs or a RAID array that exceeds 125 MB/s
- You stream 4K content from a NAS to multiple clients simultaneously
- You have a new mini PC with 2.5GbE but your switch is Gigabit (bottleneck)

**Don't bother if:**
- You mainly stream media (Jellyfin/Plex) — 4K HDR needs ~80 Mbps, well within Gigabit
- Your NAS has a single HDD (most single HDDs max at 150-200 MB/s — Gigabit is nearly sufficient)
- You only run Docker containers that don't move large files
- Your internet connection is under 1 Gbps (2.5GbE only helps local network speed)

## Best 2.5GbE Switches

### TRENDnet TEG-S350 — Best 5-Port

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Ports | 5x 2.5GbE |
| Backplane | 25 Gbps |
| Management | Unmanaged |
| Fanless | Yes |
| Power | ~5W |
| Price | ~$60 |

Five 2.5GbE ports, fanless, tiny form factor. Plug it in and it works — auto-negotiation handles 100M/1G/2.5G connections. This is the default recommendation for homelabs.

### QNAP QSW-1105-5T — Alternative 5-Port

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Ports | 5x 2.5GbE |
| Backplane | 25 Gbps |
| Management | Unmanaged |
| Fanless | Yes |
| Price | ~$65 |

Similar specs to the TRENDnet. QNAP builds reliable network equipment. Either is a good choice.

### TRENDnet TEG-S380 — Best 8-Port

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Ports | 8x 2.5GbE |
| Backplane | 40 Gbps |
| Management | Unmanaged |
| Fanless | Yes |
| Price | ~$100 |

If you need more than 5 ports. Eight 2.5GbE ports, still fanless.

### QNAP QSW-M2108-2S — Best Managed with 10GbE Uplinks

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Ports | 8x 2.5GbE + 2x 10GbE SFP+ |
| Management | Layer 2 managed (VLAN, LACP, QoS) |
| Fanless | Yes |
| Price | ~$200 |

For users who want VLANs and 10GbE uplinks to a NAS. The two SFP+ ports give you a 10GbE path to high-performance storage while everything else runs at 2.5GbE. Use DAC cables for the 10GbE connections.

### Comparison Table

| Switch | Ports | Speed | Managed | Fanless | Price |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| TRENDnet TEG-S350 | 5 | 2.5GbE | No | Yes | ~$60 |
| QNAP QSW-1105-5T | 5 | 2.5GbE | No | Yes | ~$65 |
| TRENDnet TEG-S380 | 8 | 2.5GbE | No | Yes | ~$100 |
| QNAP QSW-M2108-2S | 8+2 | 2.5G + 10G | L2 | Yes | ~$200 |

## 2.5GbE Network Adapters

If your machine doesn't have 2.5GbE built in, add it with a USB or PCIe adapter.

### USB 3.0 to 2.5GbE Adapters

| Adapter | Chip | OS Support | Price |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| Cable Matters USB-C 2.5G | Realtek RTL8156B | Windows, Linux, macOS | ~$15 |
| Plugable USB-C 2.5G | Realtek RTL8156B | Windows, Linux, macOS | ~$18 |
| UGREEN USB-C 2.5G | Realtek RTL8156B | Windows, Linux, macOS | ~$16 |

All three use the same **Realtek RTL8156B** chip and work identically. Linux support is built into the kernel since 5.13 — no driver installation needed. Buy whichever is cheapest.

**Important:** Use a **USB 3.0** port, not USB 2.0. USB 2.0 maxes out at 480 Mbps (60 MB/s), bottlenecking a 2.5GbE connection.

### PCIe 2.5GbE NICs

| NIC | Chip | Interface | Price |
|-----|------|----------|-------|
| TP-Link TX201 | Realtek RTL8125BG | PCIe x1 | ~$15 |
| ASUS XG-C100C | Aquantia AQC113C | PCIe x1 | ~$30 |
| Intel I225-V | Intel I225-V | PCIe x1 | ~$20 (used) |

PCIe adapters give better performance and lower CPU usage than USB adapters. The TP-Link TX201 at $15 is hard to beat.

**Intel I225-V note:** Early revisions (B1, B2) had known stability issues with packet loss and disconnects. Revision B3 and later are fixed. If buying used, check the revision on the chip itself.

### Built-In 2.5GbE

Most Intel N100 mini PCs ship with 2.5GbE built in:
- Minisforum UM560XT — 2x 2.5GbE
- Beelink EQ12 — 2x 2.5GbE
- Beelink S12 Pro — 1x 2.5GbE
- ASUS PN42 — 1x 2.5GbE

Synology and QNAP NAS units from 2023+ also include 2.5GbE ports:
- Synology DS224+ — 2x 1GbE (no 2.5GbE, needs USB adapter)
- Synology DS423+ — 2x 2.5GbE
- QNAP TS-264 — 2x 2.5GbE

## Cabling

**2.5GbE works on existing Cat5e cables.** That's the key advantage — no rewiring needed.

| Cable | 2.5GbE Support | 5GbE Support | 10GbE Support |
|-------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Cat5e | Yes (up to 100m) | Yes (up to 100m) | No |
| Cat6 | Yes (up to 100m) | Yes (up to 100m) | Yes (up to 55m) |
| Cat6a | Yes (up to 100m) | Yes (up to 100m) | Yes (up to 100m) |

If your house already has Cat5e in the walls, you can upgrade to 2.5GbE without touching a single cable.

## Network Design

### Simplest Upgrade

Replace your Gigabit switch with a 2.5GbE switch. Connect your server and NAS to it. Everything else can stay on Gigabit — the 2.5GbE switch auto-negotiates down to 1 Gbps for older devices.

```
[Router (1GbE)] → [2.5GbE Switch]
                      ├── NAS (2.5GbE)         — 312 MB/s to server
                      ├── Server (2.5GbE)       — 312 MB/s to NAS
                      ├── Desktop (1GbE)        — 125 MB/s (auto-negotiated)
                      └── Laptop (WiFi via AP)
```

### Dedicated Storage Network

For more demanding setups, use a second 2.5GbE switch as a dedicated storage network:

```
[Router (1GbE)] → [Main Switch (1GbE)] → all devices (internet, general LAN)

[2.5GbE Switch] → NAS (2.5GbE, second NIC)
                → Server (2.5GbE, second NIC)
                → Workstation (2.5GbE, second NIC)
```

This keeps high-bandwidth storage traffic off your main network. Useful for video editing workstations or backup servers.

## Performance: Real-World Numbers

| Scenario | Gigabit | 2.5GbE | Improvement |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Large file copy (SSD to SSD over NFS) | 112 MB/s | 280 MB/s | 2.5x |
| Large file copy (RAID to SSD over SMB) | 118 MB/s | 295 MB/s | 2.5x |
| Rsync backup (mixed files) | 95 MB/s | 210 MB/s | 2.2x |
| Time Machine backup (macOS) | 105 MB/s | 260 MB/s | 2.5x |
| Plex 4K HDR stream | 80 Mbps | 80 Mbps | No difference |
| Docker container traffic | <10 Mbps | <10 Mbps | No difference |

**Key takeaway:** 2.5GbE helps with bulk file transfers and backups. It doesn't help with streaming or typical container workloads that use minimal bandwidth.

## Power Consumption

| Component | Power |
|-----------|-------|
| 2.5GbE switch (5-port, fanless) | ~5W |
| USB 2.5GbE adapter | ~0.5W |
| PCIe 2.5GbE NIC | ~1W |

Negligible. A 5-port 2.5GbE switch running 24/7 costs about **$5/year** in electricity at $0.12/kWh.

## 2.5GbE vs 10GbE — Which to Choose

| Factor | 2.5GbE | 10GbE |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Speed | 312 MB/s | 1.25 GB/s |
| Cable required | Cat5e (existing) | Cat6a or DAC |
| Switch cost (5-port) | ~$60 | ~$150+ |
| NIC cost | ~$15 | ~$30-80 |
| Power | ~5W per switch | ~15-30W per switch |
| Noise | Fanless | Often requires fan |
| Sweet spot | File transfers, backups | NAS with SSD pool, iSCSI, video editing |

**Choose 2.5GbE** for most homelabs. It's 2.5x faster than Gigabit, uses existing cables, and costs almost nothing.

**Choose 10GbE** if you have a NAS with SSD storage that can actually saturate 10 Gbps, or if you do real-time video editing off a NAS. See our [10GbE Networking Guide](/hardware/10gbe-networking) for details.

## FAQ

### Will 2.5GbE work with my existing router?
Yes. Your router stays at 1 Gbps. The 2.5GbE switch connects to the router at 1 Gbps (auto-negotiation). Local traffic between 2.5GbE devices runs at full speed. Internet-bound traffic is still limited by your router/ISP speed.

### Do I need to change any software settings?
No. 2.5GbE is auto-negotiated by the hardware. NFS, SMB, rsync — they all just run faster without configuration changes.

### Can I bond/aggregate two Gigabit ports instead?
Yes, using 802.3ad LACP. But link aggregation doesn't increase single-stream speed — it increases total throughput across multiple simultaneous connections. A single large file copy still runs at Gigabit speed. 2.5GbE gives you 2.5x speed per connection.

### What about WiFi 6/7 — is 2.5GbE needed for WiFi?
WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 access points can exceed Gigabit speeds wirelessly. If your AP has a 2.5GbE uplink port (many high-end APs do), connecting it to a 2.5GbE switch prevents a Gigabit bottleneck between WiFi clients and the wired network.
