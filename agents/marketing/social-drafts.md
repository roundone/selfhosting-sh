## Standalone Tips (10 Tips x 3 Platforms = 30 Posts)

### Tip 1: Docker Restart Policies

#### X (Twitter)

Add `restart: unless-stopped` to every service in your Docker Compose files. Your containers come back automatically after a reboot or crash. Without it, one power outage means manually restarting everything.

#selfhosted #docker

#### Mastodon

Quick self-hosting tip: always set a restart policy on your Docker containers.

`restart: unless-stopped` means your services come back after a reboot, a crash, or a Docker daemon restart. The only time they stay down is when you explicitly stop them.

It's the difference between a resilient setup and one that falls apart after a power flicker.

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #sysadmin

#### Bluesky

One line that saves you from manually restarting containers after every reboot:

restart: unless-stopped

Add it to every service in your Docker Compose files. Your future self will thank you after the first power outage.

---

### Tip 2: .env Files for Secrets

#### X (Twitter)

Stop hardcoding passwords in your docker-compose.yml files. Use a .env file, reference variables with ${VARIABLE_NAME}, and add .env to your .gitignore.

Your compose files become shareable. Your secrets stay local.

#selfhosted #docker

#### Mastodon

Self-hosting security tip: never put passwords or API keys directly in your docker-compose.yml.

Create a .env file next to your compose file:
```
DB_PASSWORD=your-actual-password
```

Reference it in compose:
```
environment:
  - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
```

Add .env to .gitignore. Now your compose files are safe to share or commit.

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #security #sysadmin #devops

#### Bluesky

If your docker-compose.yml has actual passwords in it, fix that today. Put secrets in a .env file, reference them as ${VARIABLE_NAME} in compose, and add .env to .gitignore.

Takes 5 minutes. Means you can actually share or version-control your configs.

---

### Tip 3: Docker Volumes vs Bind Mounts

#### X (Twitter)

Docker volumes vs bind mounts:

Volumes: Docker manages the storage. Portable, easy backups, better performance on some systems.

Bind mounts: You pick the exact path. Easier to inspect, edit configs directly, and integrate with existing backup tools.

For most self-hosting setups, bind mounts to a known directory win on simplicity.

#selfhosted #docker

#### Mastodon

Docker volumes vs bind mounts for self-hosting — here's the practical difference:

Named volumes (`myapp_data:/data`) — Docker manages where files live. Clean, portable, but the actual path is buried in /var/lib/docker/volumes/.

Bind mounts (`./data:/data`) — you choose the path. Files are right where you expect them. Easy to back up, easy to inspect.

For home servers, bind mounts to a structured directory (like /opt/selfhosted/appname/data) tend to be easier to manage long-term.

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #sysadmin #devops

#### Bluesky

Docker volumes vs bind mounts, short version:

Volumes: Docker picks where your data lives. Clean but opaque.
Bind mounts: You pick the path. Transparent and easy to back up.

For self-hosting, I usually prefer bind mounts. Knowing exactly where your Nextcloud data or Immich photos live on disk matters when it's backup time.

---

### Tip 4: Reverse Proxy Benefits

#### X (Twitter)

Running multiple self-hosted services? Put a reverse proxy in front of them.

One port exposed (443). SSL certificates handled automatically. Clean URLs like cloud.yourdomain.com instead of yourip:8443.

Nginx Proxy Manager makes this dead simple with a web UI.

#selfhosted #homelab

#### Mastodon

If you're running more than one self-hosted service, a reverse proxy changes everything:

- Access services by subdomain (cloud.yourdomain.com) instead of remembering port numbers
- Automatic SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Only ports 80 and 443 exposed to the internet
- Central access logging

Nginx Proxy Manager gives you all of this through a web UI — no config file editing needed.

Full explainer: https://selfhosting.sh/foundations/reverse-proxy-explained

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #nginx #reverseproxy #ssl #networking #sysadmin

#### Bluesky

Once you're running 3+ self-hosted services, you need a reverse proxy. Trust me on this.

Instead of remembering that Nextcloud is :8443 and Jellyfin is :8096, you get cloud.yourdomain.com and media.yourdomain.com. Auto-SSL included.

Nginx Proxy Manager handles it all with a web UI.

### Tip 5: 3-2-1 Backup Rule

#### X (Twitter)

The 3-2-1 backup rule for self-hosting:

3 copies of your data
2 different storage types
1 copy offsite

Your RAID array is not a backup. Your Docker volumes are not a backup. An automated script pushing encrypted snapshots to a remote location — that's a backup.

#selfhosted #homelab

#### Mastodon

Self-hosting means you are responsible for your data. No cloud provider is silently backing it up for you.

The 3-2-1 rule:
- 3 copies of your data
- 2 different storage media
- 1 copy offsite (different physical location)

Common self-hosting backup stack:
- Local: automated snapshots to a separate drive
- Offsite: encrypted sync to a remote server or object storage

RAID is not a backup. A second copy on the same machine is not a backup. Plan for the scenario where your entire server is gone.

https://selfhosting.sh/foundations/backup-3-2-1-rule

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #backup #sysadmin #datasecurity

#### Bluesky

Biggest self-hosting mistake: treating a RAID array as a backup.

3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite. If your house floods or your server dies, your data survives.

We wrote a full guide on implementing this for self-hosted setups:
https://selfhosting.sh/foundations/backup-3-2-1-rule

### Tip 6: Pi-hole as Network-Wide Ad Blocker

#### X (Twitter)

Pi-hole isn't just an ad blocker — it's a DNS sinkhole for your entire network. One setup, and every device in your house stops loading ads and trackers. Phones, smart TVs, IoT devices. No per-device config.

Set your router's DNS to your Pi-hole and you're done.

#selfhosted #pihole

#### Mastodon

If you've only ever blocked ads with a browser extension, Pi-hole will change your perspective.

It works at the DNS level — set it as your network's DNS server and every device on your network stops resolving ad and tracker domains. Your smart TV, your phone on WiFi, your partner's laptop, IoT devices that don't support browser extensions.

One Docker container. One DNS setting on your router. Network-wide protection.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/pi-hole

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #pihole #adblock #dns #privacy #networking

#### Bluesky

Browser ad blockers are great, but they only cover your browser. Pi-hole covers your entire network at the DNS level.

Smart TV loading ads between shows? Blocked. Phone apps phoning home to trackers? Blocked. Every device, no extensions needed.

Setup guide: https://selfhosting.sh/apps/pi-hole

### Tip 7: Vaultwarden as Bitwarden Alternative

#### X (Twitter)

You don't need to pay for Bitwarden when Vaultwarden exists.

It's a lightweight, Bitwarden-compatible server. Same browser extensions, same mobile apps, same autofill. Runs on 50MB of RAM on your own hardware.

Your passwords never touch someone else's server.

#selfhosted #security

#### Mastodon

Vaultwarden is one of the best-kept secrets in self-hosting.

It's a community-built Bitwarden-compatible server written in Rust. It uses a fraction of the resources of the official Bitwarden server but supports all the same clients — browser extensions, mobile apps, desktop apps, CLI.

Features that require Bitwarden Premium ($10/year) — like TOTP, file attachments, and emergency access — are included free in Vaultwarden.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/vaultwarden

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #vaultwarden #bitwarden #passwords #security #privacy #infosec #rust

#### Bluesky

Vaultwarden gives you everything Bitwarden does — including the premium features — running on your own server for free. Same browser extensions, same mobile apps, tiny resource footprint.

It's written in Rust and runs comfortably on the cheapest hardware you have lying around.

Guide: https://selfhosting.sh/apps/vaultwarden

### Tip 8: Immich as Google Photos Replacement

#### X (Twitter)

Google Photos gives you 15GB free and then charges monthly. Immich gives you unlimited storage on your own hardware with the same features — auto-backup, facial recognition, location maps, shared albums.

The mobile app is polished enough that non-technical family members won't complain.

#selfhosted #immich

#### Mastodon

The most common question in self-hosting communities: "What replaces Google Photos?"

The answer in 2026 is Immich. It has:
- Automatic phone backup (iOS + Android)
- Facial recognition and smart search
- Map view with location data
- Shared albums and user management
- A mobile app that genuinely rivals Google Photos

It's been developing fast and the experience is now good enough for non-technical users in your household.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/immich

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #immich #googlephotos #photography #privacy #degoogle

#### Bluesky

"What's the self-hosted Google Photos replacement?"

Immich. And it's not even close anymore.

Auto-backup from your phone, facial recognition, shared albums, maps view. The app is good enough that I set it up for family members who don't know what Docker is.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/immich

---

### Tip 9: Docker Compose for Reproducibility

#### X (Twitter)

Never run `docker run` for services you want to keep. Write a docker-compose.yml instead.

Your entire stack becomes a file you can version control, back up, and redeploy on new hardware in minutes. If your server dies, you're not trying to remember 30 CLI flags.

#selfhosted #docker

#### Mastodon

Self-hosting tip for beginners: learn Docker Compose before anything else.

A docker-compose.yml file is a complete, reproducible definition of your service — image, ports, volumes, environment variables, networks, restart policy. Everything in one file.

Benefits:
- Version control your entire stack
- Back up configs trivially
- Redeploy on new hardware in minutes
- Share setups with others exactly

Stop running `docker run` with 15 flags. Write it down in compose once and never think about it again.

https://selfhosting.sh/foundations/docker-compose-basics

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #devops #sysadmin #containers

#### Bluesky

Biggest upgrade for any self-hosting setup: switch every `docker run` command to a docker-compose.yml file.

Your entire stack becomes a text file. Version control it. Back it up. When your server dies (not if), you redeploy everything in minutes instead of spending a weekend reconstructing flags from memory.

---

### Tip 10: SSH Key Auth over Passwords

#### X (Twitter)

If your server still accepts SSH passwords, fix that today.

Generate a key pair. Copy the public key to your server. Disable password auth in sshd_config. Now your server is immune to brute-force attacks and you never type a password again.

Takes 5 minutes. Massively improves security.

#selfhosted #security

#### Mastodon

Security baseline for any self-hosted server: disable SSH password authentication.

The steps:
1. Generate a key pair: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
2. Copy to server: `ssh-copy-id user@yourserver`
3. Disable password auth: set `PasswordAuthentication no` in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
4. Restart sshd

Key-based auth is immune to brute-force password attacks. Combined with fail2ban, your SSH surface is about as small as it gets without a VPN.

Full guide: https://selfhosting.sh/foundations/ssh-setup

#selfhosted #homelab #linux #foss #opensource #ssh #security #sysadmin #infosec #privacy

#### Bluesky

Your self-hosted server is only as secure as its SSH config. If it still accepts passwords, every bot on the internet is trying to guess them right now.

Switch to key-based auth. It takes 5 minutes:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519
ssh-copy-id user@server
Set PasswordAuthentication no in sshd_config

Guide: https://selfhosting.sh/foundations/ssh-setup

## Additional Article Promotion Posts (Batch 2 — new articles since initial drafts)

### Caddy

#### X (Twitter)

Caddy might be the easiest reverse proxy to set up. Automatic HTTPS out of the box — no Let's Encrypt scripts, no cron jobs, no renewal headaches. Just point it at your services and it handles the rest.

Guide: https://selfhosting.sh/apps/caddy

#selfhosted #homelab

#### Mastodon

If Nginx Proxy Manager's UI feels like overkill and raw Nginx config feels tedious, Caddy sits in the sweet spot.

It gets HTTPS certificates automatically for every domain you configure. No certbot. No renewal cron. No manual key management. Caddy handles everything via ACME and serves your sites over HTTPS by default.

The Caddyfile config format is dead simple compared to nginx.conf.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/caddy

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #caddy #reverseproxy #https #letsencrypt #webserver

#### Bluesky

Hot take: Caddy is the best reverse proxy for most self-hosters. Automatic HTTPS with zero configuration, a config format that's actually readable, and it just works.

If you're tired of fighting with Nginx configs and certbot cron jobs, give it a shot.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/caddy

### Watchtower

#### X (Twitter)

Watchtower watches your Docker containers for image updates and automatically pulls + restarts them. Set it up once and your self-hosted stack stays current without you lifting a finger.

One container to rule them all.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/watchtower

#selfhosted #docker

#### Mastodon

Keeping Docker containers updated is tedious. Check Docker Hub for new images, pull them, recreate containers, verify everything works.

Watchtower automates the entire process. It monitors your running containers, checks for updated images, and gracefully recreates containers with the new image. Configure notifications so you know what changed.

Caveat: enable monitoring-only mode first and whitelist specific containers. You probably don't want every container auto-updating without testing.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/watchtower

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #watchtower #devops #containers #automation

#### Bluesky

"How do you keep all your Docker containers updated?"

Watchtower. It monitors your containers, pulls new images when available, and recreates them automatically. You can set it to notify-only mode if auto-updates make you nervous.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/watchtower

---

### PhotoPrism

#### X (Twitter)

PhotoPrism is an AI-powered photo manager you run on your own hardware. Face recognition, smart search, map view, RAW support. If you want Google Photos features without the Google part.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/photoprism

#selfhosted #photography

#### Mastodon

Looking for a self-hosted photo manager with AI features? PhotoPrism indexes your existing library and adds:

- Facial recognition and clustering
- Object classification and smart search
- Location mapping
- RAW file support
- Video and live photo support

It works with your existing folder structure — no migration required. Point it at your photos directory and let it index.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/photoprism

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #photoprism #photography #photos #ai #privacy #degoogle

#### Bluesky

Two strong options for self-hosted photo management right now: Immich and PhotoPrism.

PhotoPrism is the more mature option — great for indexing an existing library. Face recognition, object search, RAW support, maps view. Works with your existing folder structure.

https://selfhosting.sh/apps/photoprism

### Jellyfin vs Plex (Comparison)

#### X (Twitter)

Jellyfin vs Plex — the definitive breakdown. One is fully free and open-source. The other has more polish but locks features behind a paywall.

We wrote the comparison so you don't have to test both: https://selfhosting.sh/compare/jellyfin-vs-plex

#selfhosted #homelab

#### Mastodon

The question that never gets old: Jellyfin or Plex?

We wrote a thorough comparison covering:
- Client support and app quality
- Transcoding performance
- Library management
- Free vs paid features
- Hardware requirements
- Privacy considerations

TLDR: Plex has more polished clients. Jellyfin is fully free, fully open-source, and doesn't phone home. Both work well.

https://selfhosting.sh/compare/jellyfin-vs-plex

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #jellyfin #plex #mediaserver #streaming

#### Bluesky

Jellyfin vs Plex is probably the most common debate in self-hosting. We broke it down with actual side-by-side comparisons instead of just vibes.

Short version: Plex for polish, Jellyfin for freedom.

https://selfhosting.sh/compare/jellyfin-vs-plex

### Pi-hole vs AdGuard Home (Comparison)

#### X (Twitter)

Pi-hole or AdGuard Home? Both block ads at the DNS level across your network. We compared setup complexity, filtering options, UI quality, and resource usage.

The answer depends on what you care about most: https://selfhosting.sh/compare/pi-hole-vs-adguard-home

#selfhosted #pihole

#### Mastodon

Choosing a network-wide ad blocker? The two main options are Pi-hole and AdGuard Home.

Both work as DNS sinkholes. Both block ads and trackers for every device on your network. But they differ in:
- UI and configuration style
- Encryption support (DoH/DoT/DoQ)
- Filtering approaches
- Custom filtering rules

Full breakdown: https://selfhosting.sh/compare/pi-hole-vs-adguard-home

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #pihole #adguardhome #dns #adblocking #privacy #networking

#### Bluesky

Pi-hole vs AdGuard Home — which network-wide ad blocker should you run?

Both are excellent. Pi-hole is the classic with a huge community. AdGuard Home has a more modern UI and built-in encrypted DNS. We compared them in detail.

https://selfhosting.sh/compare/pi-hole-vs-adguard-home

### Self-Hosted Google Photos Alternative (Replace Guide)

#### X (Twitter)

Paying Google $3/month for photo storage? Run Immich on your own hardware instead. Same auto-backup, same smart search, unlimited storage. Our replace guide walks through the full migration.

https://selfhosting.sh/replace/google-photos

#selfhosted #degoogle

#### Mastodon

Google Photos gives you 15GB free, then charges monthly. Here's what you get by self-hosting your photos instead:

- Unlimited storage (limited only by your drives)
- No AI training on your personal photos
- No terms of service changes deleting your account
- Face recognition and smart search (via Immich or PhotoPrism)
- Full control over your data

We wrote a complete guide on replacing Google Photos with self-hosted alternatives, including migration steps.

https://selfhosting.sh/replace/google-photos

#selfhosted #homelab #docker #linux #foss #opensource #googlephotos #degoogle #privacy #photography #immich

#### Bluesky

Google Photos: 15GB free, then $3/month. Plus they scan your photos and use them for AI training.

Self-hosted alternative: unlimited storage, no scanning, same mobile auto-backup and search features. Costs whatever a hard drive costs.

Migration guide: https://selfhosting.sh/replace/google-photos
