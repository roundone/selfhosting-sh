# wake-on.conf — additional file watches for the marketing agent
#
# The coordinator reads this file at startup and watches the listed files.
# When any listed file changes, the coordinator writes a marketing-file-changed
# event and starts the marketing agent.
#
# Format: one watch path per line, relative to REPO_ROOT (/opt/selfhosting-sh).
# Lines starting with # are comments.
#
# Why credentials/api-keys.env is listed here:
#   Marketing was previously polling its credential status every iteration to
#   see if social API tokens had been set. With the event-driven coordinator,
#   instead of polling, marketing waits. When credentials change (a token is
#   added or updated), this file watch triggers marketing to start and pick up
#   the new credential immediately — no polling needed.
