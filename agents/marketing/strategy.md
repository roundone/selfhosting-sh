# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-20 (iteration 9)

## Current Priorities

1. **Content velocity recovering, 651 articles published** — Operations restarted production. AI/ML (22/22) and Search Engines (18/18) COMPLETE. 5 categories from CRITICAL brief in progress. Sent new briefs for 4 more categories (72 articles): *arr stack, Ebooks & Reading, Wiki & Documentation, DNS & Networking. 57 categories still have 0 articles.
2. **Comparison articles remain #1 SEO priority** — GSC confirms: comparison articles index and rank fastest. Only indexed page is a comparison (position 3.0). All categories must produce comparisons first.
3. **Social posting velocity 3x improved** — CEO reduced intervals: X every 15 min ($28.80/month), Bluesky every 10 min (free). ~240 posts/day on 2 active platforms. Queue: ~1,937 posts. Drain time: ~8 days (was ~27 days).
4. **GSC holding steady at day 5** — 9 pages with impressions, 0 clicks. Sitemap clean (0 warnings, 0 errors). Google re-downloaded sitemap today. Expect AI/ML content to start showing impressions by Feb 22-23.
5. **Next wave of content briefs sent** — 4 new categories (72 articles) sent to Operations: Media Organization (*arr stack), Ebooks & Reading, Wiki & Documentation, DNS & Networking. These need writer assignments.
6. **Internal link audit overdue** — 651+ articles. Orphan pages likely in new categories.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 5,000 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |
| No affiliate disclosures until founder instructs | Zero active affiliate relationships; premature disclosures damage trust | Feb 19, 2026 (founder directive) |
| Queue-only social posting | All social posts go through queues/social-queue.jsonl — never call APIs directly | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO directive) |
| Comparison content is highest SEO priority | **CONFIRMED by GSC** — only indexed page is a comparison article. Position 3.0 within 4 days. | Feb 20, 2026 (GSC data) |
| Prioritize comparisons BEFORE app guides in new categories | Comparisons rank faster and with less content; app guides support them | Feb 20, 2026 |
| X posting at 15-min intervals | Pay-per-use at $0.01/tweet, 100/15min rate limit. ~$28.80/month. Well within budget. | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO set) |

## What We've Tried

| Approach | Outcome | Date |
|----------|---------|------|
| Topic map initial build (905 articles / 63 categories) | Complete. Expanded to 1,224/78. | Feb 17-18, 2026 |
| awesome-selfhosted mining for topic map expansion | Found 1,090 missing apps (587 with Docker). Created 19 new categories. | Feb 18, 2026 |
| Social queue flood (1,717 posts) | Generated 1,608 article promos + 54 standalone tips. X + Bluesky active. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| GSC analysis day 5 (iter 6) | 9 pages with impressions, 0 clicks. Comparisons rank fastest. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| GSC deep-pull day 5 (iter 7) | Only 1 page CONFIRMED indexed (freshrss-vs-miniflux). Homepage not indexed. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| CRITICAL content brief — 7 categories | Operations delivered AI/ML + Search Engines (40 articles). 5 more in progress. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| AI/ML + Search social queue (120 posts) | 40 articles × 3 platforms queued. Queue reached 1,934. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| Social poster interval reduction | CEO reduced X: 60→15 min, Bluesky: 30→10 min. Queue drain: 27→8 days. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| 4-category content brief (72 articles) | *arr stack, Ebooks, Wiki, DNS & Networking briefed to Operations. | Feb 20, 2026 |

## Open Questions

- When will homepage get indexed? Still "Discovered - currently not indexed" since Feb 16 (5 days).
- Will AI/ML comparison articles index as fast as freshrss-vs-miniflux? Expect data by Feb 22-23.
- Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode credentials still pending — limits social reach to 2 platforms.
- Content velocity at 651 articles is far below month-1 target (5,000). Can writers sustain 200+/day?
- When will Operations assign writers to the 4 new categories from this iteration's brief?
