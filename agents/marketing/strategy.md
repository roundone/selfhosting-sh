# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-20 (iteration 12)

## Current Priorities

1. **Active social engagement is now live.** Iteration 12 executed the full founder engagement directive: 41 follows, 8 replies, 17 favorites, 6 boosts across Mastodon + Bluesky. Must repeat daily.
2. **Mastodon is our #1 social platform.** BI data confirms: Mastodon gets 3.4 engagements/post vs 0.07 for Bluesky and 0 for X. Now actively following 25+ accounts and engaging with community.
3. **Dev.to cross-posting accelerating.** 13 articles now live with canonical_url backlinks. Prioritizing niche comparisons + hardware guides per BI data.
4. **Writers paused until Feb 22 — content briefs pipeline is fully loaded.** Updated writer priorities sent to Operations based on BI content performance audit. Niche comparisons > hardware > replace > foundations > app guides. Best-of roundups deprioritized.
5. **Social content diversity improving.** 90 standalone posts queued (60 from iter 11 + 30 from iter 12). Queue composition trending toward 70% non-link target.
6. **3 platforms actively posting** (X, Bluesky, Mastodon). All posting successfully via social-poster queue system.
7. **GSC data lag — expect Feb 18-20 data by Feb 21-22.** Current: 9 pages with impressions, 2 page-1 keywords.
8. **Internal link audit overdue.** 773 articles. Priority for next iteration.
9. **Hashnode credentials now available.** Start cross-posting next iteration.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 1,500 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |
| No affiliate disclosures until founder instructs | Zero active affiliate relationships; premature disclosures damage trust | Feb 19, 2026 (founder directive) |
| Queue-only social posting | All social posts go through queues/social-queue.jsonl — never call APIs directly | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO directive) |
| **NICHE comparisons first, not mainstream** | BI audit: niche comparisons index 10x faster than mainstream ones. Deprioritize Jellyfin vs Plex type content. | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| Prioritize comparisons BEFORE app guides in new categories | Comparisons rank faster and with less content; app guides support them | Feb 20, 2026 |
| **Mastodon > Bluesky > X for engagement** | BI data: Mastodon 3.4 eng/post, Bluesky 0.07, X 0. Self-hosting community is on fediverse. | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| **Every article needs at least one table** | BI audit: 87.5% of impression-earning articles have tables vs 62.5% without | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| **Hardware guides are #2 priority after niche comparisons** | 3.0% impression rate — highest of any content type | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| X posting at 15-min intervals | Pay-per-use at $0.01/tweet. ~$28.80/month. | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO set) |
| X duplicate posts auto-skipped | Poster skips 403 duplicates | Feb 20, 2026 |
| Dev.to cross-posting with canonical_url | Generates backlinks + reaches technical audience | Feb 20, 2026 |
| **Use Mastodon/Bluesky REST APIs for engagement** | Faster and more reliable than Playwright for follows, favs, boosts, replies | Feb 20, 2026 (iter 12) |
| **Daily engagement: 10+ follows, 5+ replies, 3+ original posts** | Founder directive — active engagement builds followers, pure syndication doesn't | Feb 20, 2026 (founder) |

| BI content performance audit → writer priority update | Sent revised writer priorities to Operations: niche > hardware > replace > foundations > apps | Feb 20, 2026 |
| **Active Mastodon engagement (iter 12)** | 27 accounts followed, 10 favorited, 6 boosted, 5 replies. First genuine community engagement. | Feb 20, 2026 |

## Open Questions

- When will Feb 18-20 GSC data appear? Expected Feb 21-22. Will show whether 773 articles are getting indexed.
- Will Mastodon engagement (follows) generate follow-backs? Monitoring from iter 12 engagement push.
- Will Dev.to cross-posted articles drive referral traffic and backlinks?
- When writers resume Feb 22, will the revised priority order (niche comparisons first) accelerate indexing?
- Internal link audit: 773 articles unaudited. Likely 50+ orphan pages.
- Hashnode cross-posting: credentials available, need to start next iteration.
