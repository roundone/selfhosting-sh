# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-20 (iteration 8)

## Current Priorities

1. **Content velocity recovering** — Operations restarted production. AI/ML (22/22) and Search Engines (18/18) categories now COMPLETE. 5 more categories from CRITICAL brief in progress (Social Networks, Task Management, Video Surveillance, Music & Audio, Container Orchestration). Content velocity is back but still below month-1 target (638 articles vs 5,000).
2. **Comparison articles remain #1 SEO priority** — GSC confirms: comparison articles index and rank fastest. Our only indexed page is a comparison (position 3.0). All new categories must produce comparisons first.
3. **Social queue healthy at 1,934 posts** — X posting every 60 min, Bluesky every 30 min. Queue covers ~27 days X, ~13 days Bluesky at current rates. 120 new AI/ML + Search Engine posts added this iteration.
4. **GSC monitoring** — 9 pages with impressions, 0 clicks (day 5). Sitemap warnings CLEARED (was 3, now 0). Google re-downloaded sitemap today. Expect AI/ML content to start showing impressions by Feb 22-23.
5. **Next wave of content briefs needed** — 57 categories still have 0 articles. Priority: Media Organization (*arr stack), Wiki & Documentation, Ebooks & Reading, Notification Services. Need to send formal briefs to Operations.
6. **Internal link audit overdue** — 638+ articles. Orphan pages likely in new categories. Will schedule after next brief batch.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 5,000 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |
| No affiliate disclosures until founder instructs | Zero active affiliate relationships; premature disclosures damage trust | Feb 19, 2026 (founder directive) |
| Queue-only social posting | All social posts go through queues/social-queue.jsonl — never call APIs directly | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO directive) |
| Comparison content is highest SEO priority | **CONFIRMED by GSC** — only indexed page is a comparison article. Position 3.0 within 4 days. | Feb 20, 2026 (GSC data) |
| Prioritize comparisons BEFORE app guides in new categories | Comparisons rank faster and with less content; app guides support them | Feb 20, 2026 |

## What We've Tried

| Approach | Outcome | Date |
|----------|---------|------|
| Topic map initial build (905 articles / 63 categories) | Complete. Expanded to 1,224/78. | Feb 17-18, 2026 |
| awesome-selfhosted mining for topic map expansion | Found 1,090 missing apps (587 with Docker). Created 19 new categories. | Feb 18, 2026 |
| Social queue flood (1,717 posts) | Generated 1,608 article promos + 54 standalone tips. X + Bluesky active. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| GSC analysis day 5 (iter 6) | 9 pages with impressions, 0 clicks. Comparisons rank fastest. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| GSC deep-pull day 5 (iter 7) | Only 1 page CONFIRMED indexed (freshrss-vs-miniflux). Homepage not indexed. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| CRITICAL content brief — 7 categories | Operations delivered AI/ML + Search Engines (40 articles). 5 more in progress. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| AI/ML + Search social queue (120 posts) | 40 articles × 3 platforms queued. Queue at 1,934. | Feb 20, 2026 |

## Open Questions

- When will homepage get indexed? It's been "Discovered - currently not indexed" since Feb 16 (5 days).
- Will AI/ML comparison articles index as fast as freshrss-vs-miniflux? Expect data by Feb 22-23.
- Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode credentials still pending — limits social reach to 2 platforms.
- Content velocity still far below month-1 target (638 vs 5,000). Can writers sustain 200+/day?
