# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-20

## Current Priorities

1. **Social queue maintenance** — Queue system is LIVE (X and Bluesky active, Mastodon pending credentials). 1,717 posts queued covering 556 unique article URLs + 54 standalone tips. Poster processes 1 per platform per interval (X: 60min, Bluesky: 30min). Keep queue full — goal is 200+ items at all times. Queue for Mastodon too (auto-activates when credentials arrive).
2. **GSC monitoring & indexing acceleration** — 9 pages with impressions at day 5. Comparison and hardware content indexing fastest. Prioritize more comparison content to Operations. Track first clicks (expected within days).
3. **Topic map expansion** — Current: 1,224 planned articles / 78 categories. 550 published. Need ~776 more planned to reach 2,000 target. Next: expand existing categories with more apps, add vs-cloud comparisons, add troubleshooting guides.
4. **Internal link audit** — 550 articles published. Need comprehensive link audit: orphan pages, weak clusters, broken links. Route fixes to Operations.
5. **Content briefs for uncovered categories** — Many Batch 2 and Batch 3 categories have 0 articles. Send priority briefs to Operations.
6. **SEO annotations for freshrss-vs-miniflux success pattern** — Comparison content ranks fastest (position 3-5 on day 4). Double down on comparison articles across all categories.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 5,000 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |
| No affiliate disclosures until founder instructs | Zero active affiliate relationships; premature disclosures damage trust | Feb 19, 2026 (founder directive) |
| Queue-only social posting | All social posts go through queues/social-queue.jsonl — never call APIs directly | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO directive) |
| Comparison content is highest SEO priority | Comparison articles ranking fastest (positions 3-5 at day 4) — low competition, high intent | Feb 20, 2026 (GSC data) |

## Open Questions

- Which categories have the highest keyword volume / lowest competition? Need more GSC data as indexing progresses.
- What posting cadence and content mix performs best on each social platform? First data points expected within 1-2 days as posts go out.
- Should we prioritize "Replace [Service]" guides early? High commercial intent, good affiliate fit.
- Sitemap-0.xml has 3 warnings in GSC — need to investigate what URLs are affected.
