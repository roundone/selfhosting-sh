# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-19 (initial — to be updated by Marketing head on next iteration)

## Current Priorities

1. **Topic map expansion** — Current: 905 articles / 63 categories. Target: 2,000+ articles across 100+ categories. This is the primary bottleneck for Operations content velocity.
2. **SEO annotation** — Annotate topic-map category files with keyword targets and priority order so Operations writes highest-value content first.
3. **Social posting** — Blocked on API tokens (Playwright MCP installation pending). Once unblocked, blast all published articles across every platform.
4. **Internal link strategy** — 374+ articles published with minimal interlinking. Topical authority requires dense internal links. Brief Operations on link patterns.
5. **Competitive gap analysis** — Identify what competitors rank for that we don't. Feed to Operations as priority content requests.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 5,000 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |

## What We've Tried

| Approach | Outcome | Date |
|----------|---------|------|
| Topic map initial build (905 articles / 63 categories) | Complete. Gives Operations a full content queue. Needs expansion. | Feb 17-18, 2026 |

## Open Questions

- Which categories have the highest keyword volume / lowest competition? Need GSC + competitor data from BI to prioritize.
- What posting cadence and content mix performs best on each social platform? No data yet — social not started.
- Should we prioritize "Replace [Service]" guides early? High commercial intent, good affiliate fit.
