# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-20 (iteration 13)

## Current Priorities

1. **GSC data exploded — 15 page-1 keywords, 518 impressions, 22 pages indexed.** Impressions jumped 24 → 494 in one day (Feb 17→18). Google is entering rapid indexing phase. Site authority is building faster than expected.
2. **Active social engagement is a daily standing activity.** Iterations 12-13 executed full engagement directive: 98 total follows (52 Mastodon + 43 Bluesky + 3 follow-backs), 20 replies, 28 favorites, 17 boosts. Must repeat every iteration.
3. **Mastodon remains #1 social platform.** 52 following, organic boosts/favorites/follows received from community. Self-hosting community is on fediverse.
4. **Dev.to cross-posting at 21 articles.** Hashnode cross-posting launched at 5 articles. Both generating canonical_url backlinks. Continue expanding to cover all high-performing content.
5. **Near-page-1 keywords identified for optimization.** HAProxy vs Nginx page at positions 17-18 needs performance/reverse-proxy sections. Brief sent to Operations.
6. **Writers paused until Feb 22 — content briefs pipeline fully loaded.** 5 category briefs ready for Feb 22 restart (76 articles). Plus existing in-progress briefs for 7+ categories.
7. **Social content diversity on track.** 120 standalone posts queued total. Queue ~2,014 posts with improving non-link ratio.
8. **3 platforms actively posting** (X, Bluesky, Mastodon). Dev.to and Hashnode for cross-posting. Reddit still BLOCKED.
9. **Homepage not indexed — flagged to Technology.** Unusual after 4+ days when 22 other pages have impressions.
10. **Internal link audit still overdue.** 778 articles unaudited. Priority for next iteration.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 1,500 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |
| No affiliate disclosures until founder instructs | Zero active affiliate relationships; premature disclosures damage trust | Feb 19, 2026 (founder directive) |
| Queue-only social posting | All social posts go through queues/social-queue.jsonl — never call APIs directly | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO directive) |
| **NICHE comparisons first, not mainstream** | BI audit + GSC data: niche comparisons index 10x faster. 6 of top 10 impression pages are comparisons. | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data, confirmed iter 13 GSC) |
| Prioritize comparisons BEFORE app guides in new categories | Comparisons rank faster and with less content; app guides support them | Feb 20, 2026 |
| **Mastodon > Bluesky > X for engagement** | BI data: Mastodon 3.4 eng/post. Active engagement generating follow-backs. | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| **Every article needs at least one table** | BI audit: 87.5% of impression-earning articles have tables vs 62.5% without | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| **Hardware guides are #2 priority after niche comparisons** | Proxmox hardware guide at 181 impressions — highest single page by far | Feb 20, 2026 (confirmed iter 13 GSC) |
| X posting at 15-min intervals | Pay-per-use at $0.01/tweet. ~$28.80/month. | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO set) |
| X duplicate posts auto-skipped | Poster skips 403 duplicates | Feb 20, 2026 |
| Dev.to + Hashnode cross-posting with canonical_url | Generates backlinks + reaches technical audiences on two platforms | Feb 20, 2026 |
| **Use Mastodon/Bluesky REST APIs for engagement** | Faster and more reliable than Playwright for follows, favs, boosts, replies | Feb 20, 2026 (iter 12) |
| **Daily engagement: 10+ follows, 5+ replies, 3+ original posts** | Founder directive — active engagement builds followers, pure syndication doesn't | Feb 20, 2026 (founder) |

## Open Questions

- Feb 19-20 GSC data should appear Feb 21-22 — will show whether the 494-impression day was a one-off or the start of exponential indexing.
- Will homepage get indexed? Technology investigating potential crawl blockers.
- Are Mastodon follows generating sustained follow-backs? Early data shows organic engagement (boosts, favorites) on our posts.
- Will Dev.to/Hashnode cross-posts drive referral traffic and measurable backlinks?
- When writers resume Feb 22, will the 15 page-1 keywords help accelerate indexing of new content (domain authority building)?
- Internal link audit: 778 articles unaudited. Likely 50+ orphan pages. Priority for next iteration.
