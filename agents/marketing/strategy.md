# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-20 (iteration 10)

## Current Priorities

1. **Writers paused until Feb 22 — focus on social & SEO prep.** 759 articles on disk. No new content until writers resume. Using this time for content briefs, social promotion, and GSC analysis.
2. **Content briefs pipeline fully loaded for Feb 22 restart.** Sent 5 new category briefs (76 articles): File Sharing, Newsletters, Document Signing, Low-Code, Ticketing. These join the existing CRITICAL brief (partially complete) and 4-category brief (wiki complete, ebooks nearly complete, arr + DNS queued).
3. **Comparison articles remain #1 SEO priority.** GSC data still at 9 pages with impressions, 2 page-1 keywords (freshrss vs miniflux at pos 3.0). Feb 18-20 data expected Feb 21-22 due to 2-3 day processing lag.
4. **Social posting running smoothly on 2 platforms.** X posting every ~15 min, Bluesky every ~10 min. Queue at ~1,943 posts. X duplicate content issue resolved by poster's skip logic. 30 new posts queued for Wiki & Ebooks articles.
5. **GSC data unchanged — patience required.** Only Feb 17 data visible. New content (759 articles vs 516 in last Google-crawled sitemap) should trigger significant indexing acceleration when Feb 18-20 data appears.
6. **Internal link audit still overdue.** 759 articles. Orphan page risk growing in new categories.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 1,500 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |
| No affiliate disclosures until founder instructs | Zero active affiliate relationships; premature disclosures damage trust | Feb 19, 2026 (founder directive) |
| Queue-only social posting | All social posts go through queues/social-queue.jsonl — never call APIs directly | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO directive) |
| Comparison content is highest SEO priority | **CONFIRMED by GSC** — only indexed page is a comparison article. Position 3.0 within 4 days. | Feb 20, 2026 (GSC data) |
| Prioritize comparisons BEFORE app guides in new categories | Comparisons rank faster and with less content; app guides support them | Feb 20, 2026 |
| X posting at 15-min intervals | Pay-per-use at $0.01/tweet, 100/15min rate limit. ~$28.80/month. Well within budget. | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO set) |
| X duplicate posts auto-skipped | Poster skips 403 duplicates and posts next unique item. No manual intervention needed. | Feb 20, 2026 |

## What We've Tried

| Approach | Outcome | Date |
|----------|---------|------|
| Topic map initial build (905 articles / 63 categories) | Complete. Expanded to 1,224/78. | Feb 17-18, 2026 |
| awesome-selfhosted mining for topic map expansion | Found 1,090 missing apps (587 with Docker). Created 19 new categories. | Feb 18, 2026 |

| GSC analysis day 5 (iter 6-7) | 9 pages with impressions, 0 clicks. Only 1 confirmed indexed page. Comparisons rank fastest. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| CRITICAL content brief — 7 categories | AI/ML + Search Engines COMPLETE (40 articles). Wiki + Automation COMPLETE. Others in progress. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| 4-category brief (arr/ebooks/wiki/DNS) | Wiki COMPLETE (14/14). Ebooks nearly complete (15/18). arr + DNS awaiting writers. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| 5-category brief for Feb 22 restart | File Sharing, Newsletters, Doc Signing, Low-Code, Ticketing (76 articles). Ready to assign. | Feb 20, 2026 |

| X duplicate skip fix | Poster now skips 403 duplicates. X posting recovered after 08:00-09:18 UTC outage. | Feb 20, 2026 |

## Open Questions

- When will Feb 18-20 GSC data appear? Expected Feb 21-22. This is the critical data point — will show whether our 759 articles are getting indexed.
- Will AI/ML comparison articles (ollama-vs-localai, etc.) index as fast as freshrss-vs-miniflux? Expect data by Feb 22-23.
- Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode credentials still pending — limits social reach to 2 platforms.
- When writers resume Feb 22, will the content brief pipeline sustain 200+/day? 9 categories with active briefs, 5 new categories ready.
- Internal link audit: 759 articles unaudited since last audit at 98 articles. Likely 50+ orphan pages.
