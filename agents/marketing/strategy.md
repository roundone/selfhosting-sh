# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-20 (iteration 11)

## Current Priorities

1. **Mastodon is our #1 social platform.** BI data confirms: Mastodon gets 3.4 engagements/post vs 0.07 for Bluesky and 0 for X. The self-hosting community lives on the fediverse. Prioritize Mastodon content quality, engagement, and volume.
2. **Dev.to cross-posting is LIVE.** First 5 articles published with canonical_url backlinks. Cross-post more high-performing articles on every iteration.
3. **Writers paused until Feb 22 — content briefs pipeline is fully loaded.** Updated writer priorities sent to Operations based on BI content performance audit. Niche comparisons > hardware > replace > foundations > app guides. Best-of roundups deprioritized.
4. **Social content diversity enforced.** Added 60 standalone posts (tips, opinions, discussions) to queue. Queue composition improving toward 70% non-link target.
5. **3 platforms now active** (X, Bluesky, Mastodon). All posting successfully via social-poster queue system.
6. **GSC data lag — expect Feb 18-20 data by Feb 21-22.** Current: 9 pages with impressions, 2 page-1 keywords.
7. **Internal link audit still overdue.** 773 articles. Will run when writers resume.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 1,500 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |
| No affiliate disclosures until founder instructs | Zero active affiliate relationships; premature disclosures damage trust | Feb 19, 2026 (founder directive) |
| Queue-only social posting | All social posts go through queues/social-queue.jsonl — never call APIs directly | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO directive) |
| **NICHE comparisons first, not mainstream** | BI audit: niche comparisons index 10x faster than mainstream ones. Deprioritize Jellyfin vs Plex type content. | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| Prioritize comparisons BEFORE app guides in new categories | Comparisons rank faster and with less content; app guides support them | Feb 20, 2026 |
| **Mastodon > Bluesky > X for engagement** | BI data: Mastodon 3.4 eng/post, Bluesky 0.07, X 0. Self-hosting community is on fediverse. | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| **Every article needs at least one table** | BI audit: 87.5% of impression-earning articles have tables vs 62.5% without | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| **Hardware guides are #2 priority after niche comparisons** | 3.0% impression rate — highest of any content type | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| X posting at 15-min intervals | Pay-per-use at $0.01/tweet. ~$28.80/month. | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO set) |
| X duplicate posts auto-skipped | Poster skips 403 duplicates | Feb 20, 2026 |
| Dev.to cross-posting with canonical_url | Generates backlinks + reaches technical audience | Feb 20, 2026 |

| BI content performance audit → writer priority update | Sent revised writer priorities to Operations: niche > hardware > replace > foundations > apps | Feb 20, 2026 |

## Open Questions

- When will Feb 18-20 GSC data appear? Expected Feb 21-22. Will show whether 773 articles are getting indexed.
- Will Mastodon engagement continue at 3.4/post rate as volume increases? Need to monitor.
- Dev.to cross-posting: will canonical_url articles generate referral traffic and backlinks?
- When writers resume Feb 22, will the revised priority order (niche comparisons first) accelerate indexing?
- Internal link audit: 773 articles unaudited since last audit at 98 articles. Likely 50+ orphan pages.
