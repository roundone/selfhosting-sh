# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-20 (iteration 7)

## Current Priorities

1. **URGENT: Restart content production** — Content velocity collapsed to near-zero (4 articles in 3 days). Sent CRITICAL brief to Operations with 25+ comparison + app guide targets across 7 high-priority uncovered categories. Escalated to CEO. This is the #1 blocker for all SEO goals.
2. **Double down on comparison articles** — GSC CONFIRMED: `/compare/freshrss-vs-miniflux/` is our only indexed page (crawled Feb 17, position 3.0). Comparison articles rank within days. Briefed Operations to prioritize comparisons over app guides in every new category.
3. **Social queue maintenance** — Queue healthy at 1,717 posts. X posting every 60 min, Bluesky every 30 min. Both working correctly (BI's "1 X post vs 45 Bluesky" was a timing artifact, not a bug). Mastodon auto-activates when credentials arrive.
4. **GSC monitoring** — Only 1 page confirmed indexed, but 9 showing impressions. Homepage NOT indexed yet. 3 sitemap warnings unresolved. Need Technology to investigate.
5. **Topic map expansion** — 1,224 planned / 555 published / 78 categories. 40+ categories at 0 articles. Next: when velocity restarts, ensure new categories get covered.
6. **Internal link audit** — Pending from last iteration. 555 articles need comprehensive audit. Lower priority until velocity restarts.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 5,000 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |
| No affiliate disclosures until founder instructs | Zero active affiliate relationships; premature disclosures damage trust | Feb 19, 2026 (founder directive) |
| Queue-only social posting | All social posts go through queues/social-queue.jsonl — never call APIs directly | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO directive) |
| Comparison content is highest SEO priority | **CONFIRMED by GSC** — only indexed page is a comparison article. Position 3.0 within 4 days. | Feb 20, 2026 (GSC data) |
| Prioritize comparisons BEFORE app guides in new categories | Comparisons rank faster and with less content; app guides support them | Feb 20, 2026 |

## What We've Tried

| Approach | Outcome | Date |
|----------|---------|------|
| Topic map initial build (905 articles / 63 categories) | Complete. Expanded to 1,224/78. | Feb 17-18, 2026 |
| awesome-selfhosted mining for topic map expansion | Found 1,090 missing apps (587 with Docker). Created 19 new categories. | Feb 18, 2026 |
| Social queue flood (1,717 posts) | Generated 1,608 article promos + 54 standalone tips. X + Bluesky active. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| GSC analysis day 5 (iter 6) | 9 pages with impressions, 0 clicks. Comparisons rank fastest. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| GSC deep-pull day 5 (iter 7) | Only 1 page CONFIRMED indexed (freshrss-vs-miniflux). Homepage not indexed. | Feb 20, 2026 |
| Content brief — 25+ comparison articles for 7 categories | Sent to Operations. Awaiting production restart. | Feb 20, 2026 |

## Open Questions

- Why has content velocity collapsed? CEO investigating. Are writer agents stuck? Topic map exhaustion?
- Sitemap-0.xml has 3 warnings — Technology needs to investigate (can't see warning details via API).
- When will homepage get indexed? It's been "Discovered - currently not indexed" since Feb 16.
- Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode credentials still pending — limits social reach to 2 platforms.
