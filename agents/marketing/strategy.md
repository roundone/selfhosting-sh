# Marketing Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-21 (iteration 29)

## Current Priorities

1. **BUILD EXTERNAL SIGNALS — CEO's #1 priority.** Google indexing is slow for new domains. Backlinks are the #1 lever to overcome skepticism. Dev.to (30 articles), Hashnode (11 articles), Mastodon engagement (95 followers, 3 fediverse referring domains in GA4), and Bluesky all generate external signals. Continue aggressively.
2. **Writer restart moved to Feb 26 6PM UTC (was Feb 22).** Month 1 target reduced to 850 (was 1,500). We have 780 published. Need ~70 more articles in 2-3 days with 1 writer limit. Focus: absolute highest-value niche comparisons that rank fastest.
3. **GSC Feb 19-21 data expected Feb 22-23.** Feb 18 showed 494 impressions (20x jump from 24). CEO deployed several indexing fixes (sitemap lastmod, 9,893 trailing slash fixes, www→apex redirect). The data will show whether these fixes accelerated crawl efficiency.
4. **Mastodon is #1 social platform.** 95 followers, 0.60 followers/post, 3 fediverse referral sources in GA4. 45-min posting interval is optimal. Community engagement > volume. CEO set mandatory engagement limits (3 follows, 3 replies, 5 favs per iteration).
5. **Bluesky growing.** 13 followers, 124 following. Fred Brooker (521f, CIO) is a high-value connection. Active threads with several users.
6. **"traefik vs haproxy" — GSC-confirmed content opportunity.** Position 87 against wrong page. HIGH priority brief sent to Operations for Feb 26.
7. **Brand voice document governs all engagement.** `agents/marketing/brand-voice.md` — all replies follow the reply decision framework.
8. **Content briefs pipeline fully loaded for Feb 26 restart.** 5+ category briefs ready (76+ articles). Traefik vs HAProxy + remote-access + high-value niche comparisons. Only need ~70 articles — focus on the highest-value ones.
9. **3 platforms actively posting** (X, Bluesky, Mastodon). Dev.to and Hashnode for cross-posting. Reddit still BLOCKED.
10. **Social queue healthy.** ~2,646 items. Non-link ratio: ~68-70%. ~211+ hours of content at current drain rate.
11. **Newsletter strategy approved by CEO.** Weekly, Tue/Wed UTC. Homepage mention LIVE.

## Standing Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coverage breadth over depth in month 1 | 850 good articles beats 500 perfect ones for topical authority | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO, target revised Feb 21) |
| Organic + social simultaneously from day 1 | SEO compounds long-term; social drives early traffic and backlinks | Feb 2026 (inherited from CEO) |
| No affiliate links in setup tutorials | Trust-building; commissions must not influence recommendations | Feb 2026 (inherited from board) |
| No affiliate disclosures until founder instructs | Zero active affiliate relationships; premature disclosures damage trust | Feb 19, 2026 (founder directive) |
| Queue-only social posting | All social posts go through queues/social-queue.jsonl — never call APIs directly | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO directive) |
| **NICHE comparisons first, not mainstream** | BI audit + GSC data: niche comparisons index 10x faster. 6 of top 10 impression pages are comparisons. | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data, confirmed iter 13 GSC) |
| Prioritize comparisons BEFORE app guides in new categories | Comparisons rank faster and with less content; app guides support them | Feb 20, 2026 |
| **Mastodon > Bluesky > X for engagement** | BI data: Mastodon 3.4 eng/post. Active engagement generating follow-backs. | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| **Every article needs at least one table** | BI audit: 87.5% of impression-earning articles have tables vs 62.5% without | Feb 20, 2026 (BI data) |
| **Hardware guides are #2 priority after niche comparisons** | Proxmox hardware guide at 181 impressions — highest single page by far | Feb 20, 2026 (confirmed iter 13 GSC) |
| X posting at 15-min intervals | Pay-per-use at $0.01/tweet. | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO set) |
| Mastodon posting at 45-min intervals | Community pushed back on 15-min frequency. 0.62 followers/post at 45-min > 0.41 at 15-min | Feb 21, 2026 (CEO set) |
| Dev.to + Hashnode cross-posting with canonical_url | Generates backlinks + reaches technical audiences on two platforms | Feb 20, 2026 |
| **Use Mastodon/Bluesky REST APIs for engagement** | Faster and more reliable than Playwright for follows, favs, boosts, replies | Feb 20, 2026 (iter 12) |
| **Daily engagement: 10+ follows, 5+ replies, 3+ original posts** | Founder directive — active engagement builds followers, pure syndication doesn't | Feb 20, 2026 (founder) |
| **Brand voice document governs all engagement** | Founder directive — create and follow brand-voice.md before engagement | Feb 20, 2026 (founder) |
| **Newsletter: weekly, Tue/Wed** | CEO approved. Hero pick + curated articles + quick tip + community spotlight + CTA | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO approved) |
| **Comments system: SKIP** | No humans for moderation, spam risk > marginal SEO benefit | Feb 20, 2026 (CEO approved) |
| **Writer restart Feb 26 6PM UTC, 1 writer limit** | Founder directive Feb 21 — extended from Feb 22. Only need ~70 articles to hit 850 target. | Feb 21, 2026 (founder directive) |

## Open Questions

- Feb 19-21 GSC data should appear Feb 22-23 — will show whether indexing fixes (lastmod, trailing slash, www redirect) accelerated crawl.
- Will the 70 remaining articles needed for 850 target be achievable in 2-3 days with 1 writer? (yes — 23-35/day is well within a single writer's capacity)
- Social queue at ~2,646 items. Drain rate ~18/day. When writers resume, new content social promotion will add to queue.
- X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET still empty — X engagement blocked, queue-only posting continues.
- Will "traefik vs haproxy" article capture the position-87 opportunity quickly after publication?
- Mastodon token stability — new app `selfhosting-sh-engage` registered in iter 28. Monitor for revocation.
